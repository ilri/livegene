        "abstract": "<p> Cattle production in southwestern Burkina Faso is under pressure because of resource scarcity, changing climate, and cattle diseases. Well-adapted local breeds, such as Lobi taurine cattle, are increasingly replaced by more productive exotic breeds. Community-based breeding programs (CBBPs) could be a viable option for preserving the breed and improving its productivity. Presuming that CBBPs would succeed only if they align with producers\u2019 beliefs and values, we relied on a combination of conceptual frameworks (theory of basic values, rural livelihood transitions) to explore the values and beliefs of cattle producers.\u00a0 <italic>Security<\/italic> \u00a0was the respondents\u2019 dominant value in their aim to mitigate threats to livelihood, and it was closely linked to\u00a0 <italic>achievement<\/italic> \u00a0in terms of harvest and animal quantity. Livestock-oriented respondents particularly valued\u00a0 <italic>conformity<\/italic> \u00a0with accepted social roles, while\u00a0 <italic>achievement<\/italic> \u00a0and\u00a0 <italic>power<\/italic> \u00a0were more pronounced among crop-oriented respondents. We conclude that CBBPs, to be successful, will need to reduce threats to participants\u2019 livelihood and make benefits of participation immediately visible. We consider the emergence of trusted leadership from the community to be pivotal for creating momentum for novel arrangements in cattle keeping and feeding. <\/p>"

        "abstract": "Selection based on genomic predictions has become the method of choice for genetic improvement in dairy cattle. This offers huge opportunity for developing countries with little or no pedigree data, and preliminary studies have shown promising results. The African Dairy Genetic Gains (ADGG) project initiated a digital system of dairy performance data collection, accompanied by genotyping in Tanzania in 2016. Currently, ADGG has the largest body of dairy performance data generated in East Africa from a smallholder dairy system. This study examines the use of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and single-step (ss)GBLUP for the estimation of genetic parameters and accuracy of genomic prediction for daily milk yield and body weight in Tanzania. The estimates of heritability for daily milk yield from GBLUP and ssGBLUP were essentially the same, at 0.12 \u00b1 0.03. The heritability estimates for daily milk yield averaged over the whole lactation from random regression model (RRM) GBLUP or ssGBLUP were 0.22 and 0.24, respectively. The heritability of body weight from GBLUP was 0.24 \u00b1 04 but was 0.22 \u00b1 04 from the ssGBLUP analysis. Accuracy of genomic prediction for milk yield from a forward validation was 0.57 for GBLUP based on fixed regression model or 0.55 from an RRM. Corresponding estimates from ssGBLUP were 0.59 and 0.53, respectively. Accuracy for body weight, however, was much higher at 0.83 from GBLUP and 0.77 for ssGBLUP. The moderate to high levels of accuracy of genomic prediction (0.53\u20130.83) obtained for milk yield and body weight indicate that selection on the basis of genomic prediction is feasible in smallholder dairy systems and most probably the only initial possible pathway to implementing sustained genetic improvement programs in such systems."

        "abstract": "The genomes of crossbred (admixed) individuals are a mosaic of ancestral haplotypes formed by recombination in each generation. The proportion of these ancestral haplotypes in certain genomic regions can be responsible for either susceptibility or tolerance against pathogens, and for performances in production traits. Using a medium-density genomic marker panel from the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip, we estimated individual admixture proportions for Baoul\u00e9 x Zebu crossbred cattle in Burkina Faso, which were tested for trypanosome infection by direct ELISA from blood samples. Furthermore, we calculated local ancestry deviation from average for each SNP across 29 autosomes to identify potential regions under selection in the trypanotolerant Baoul\u00e9 cattle and their crossbreds. We identified significant deviation from the local average ancestry (above 5% and 10% genome-wide thresholds) on chromosomes 8 and 19 in the positive animals, while the negative ones showed higher deviation on chromosomes 6, 19, 21 and 22. Some candidate genes on chromosome 6 (PDGFRA) and chromosome 19 (CDC6) have been found associated to trypanotolerance in West African taurines. Screening for FST outliers in trypanosome positive\/ negative animals we detected seven variants putatively under selection. Finally, we identified a minimum set of highly ancestry informative markers for routine admixture testing. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of trypanotolerance in Baoul\u00e9 cattle and their crossbreeds. Furthermore, we provide a small informative marker set to monitor admixture in this valuable indigenous breed. As such, our results are important for conserving the genetic uniqueness and trypanotolerance of Baoul\u00e9 cattle, as well as for the improvement of Baoul\u00e9 and Zebu crossbreds in specific community-based breeding programs."

        "abstract": "Local chicken populations belonging to five villages in two geographically separated provinces of Sri Lanka were analyzed using twenty microsatellite markers to determine the genetic diversity of local chicken. Population genetic parameters were estimated separately for five populations based on geographic location and for eight populations based on phenotype as naked neck, long legged, crested or crown, frizzle feathered, Giriraj, commercial layer, crossbreds and non-descript chicken. The analysis revealed that there is a high genetic diversity among indigenous chicken with high number of unique alleles, mean number of alleles per locus (MNA) and higher total number of alleles per locus per population. A total of 185 microsatellite alleles were detected in 192 samples indicating a high allelic diversity. The MNA ranged from 8.10\u00b12.94 (normal village chicken) to 3.50\u00b11.36 (Giriraj) among phenotypes, and from 7.30\u00b12.74 (Tabbowa) to 6.50\u00b12.48 (Labunoruwa) among village populations. In phenotypic groups, positive inbreeding coefficient (FIS) values indicate the existence of population substructure with evidence of inbreeding. In commercial layers a high expected heterozygosity (HE=0.639\u00b10.042) and negative FIS was observed. The positive FIS and high HE in village populations can be due to the heterogeneity of samples owing to free mating facilitated by communal feeding patterns. Highly admixed nature of phenotypic populations observed was explained as a result of rearing many phenotypes by households (58%) and interactions of chicken among neighboring households (53%). There was limited or no exchange of breeding birds among households. A weak substructure was evident due to the mating system, which disregard the phenotype. Based on genetic distance, crown chicken has the highest distance to other phenotypes and the highest similarity was observed between normal local chicken and naked neck. The finding confirms the genetic wealth conserved within the populations as a result of the breeding system commonly practiced by local chicken owners. Thus, the existing chicken can be used as a harbor of gene pool which can be readily utilized in developing local breeds of chicken in future."

        "abstract": "Visible pigmentation phenotypes can be used to explore the regulation of gene expression and the evolution of coat color patterns in animals. Here, we performed whole-genome and RNA sequencing and applied genome-wide association study, comparative population genomics and biological experiments to show that the 2,809-bp-long LINE-1 insertion in the ASIP (agouti signaling protein) gene is the causative mutation for the white coat phenotype in swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). This LINE-1 insertion (3\u2032 truncated and containing only 5\u2032 UTR) functions as a strong proximal promoter that leads to a 10-fold increase in the transcription of ASIP in white buffalo skin. The 165 bp of 5\u2032 UTR transcribed from the LINE-1 is spliced into the first coding exon of ASIP, resulting in a chimeric transcript. The increased expression of ASIP prevents melanocyte maturation, leading to the absence of pigment in white buffalo skin and hairs. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the white buffalo-specific ASIP allele originated from a recent genetic transposition event in swamp buffalo. Interestingly, as a similar LINE-1 insertion has been identified in the cattle ASIP gene, we discuss the convergent mechanism of coat color evolution in the Bovini tribe."

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the effect of heat stress on milk production and describes the pattern of response of milk yield to increasing heat load, using temperature-humidity index (THI) on test-day milk records of small holder dairy cattle herds in the sub-Saharan African climate of Tanzania. Climate data obtained from aWhere, an agricultural weather data platform (http:\/\/www.awhere.com) was analysed with 14,367 first lactation test day milk records of 3511 dairy cows collected between 2016 and 2019. THI was calculated from daily maximal temperatures and daily minimum humidity. Three sets of analysis were performed. In the first and second analysis, two mixed effect repeatability models were fitted with THI treated as a categorical variable grouped into 5 classes (THI1= [61 - 66], THI2= [67 - 71], THI3= [72 - 78], THI4=[79 - 81], THI5=[82 - 86]), to obtain least squares estimates of THI effect on milk production, and as a continuous variable within THI classes to identify THI thresholds at which milk yield started to decline. In the third analyses, one quadratic polynomial regression (POL) and three regression spline functions namely piecewise linear spline function (PLF), natural splines function (NSF) and cubic splines function (CSF) were fitted to determine the average effect of THI on milk yield in the population and describe the pattern of response of milk yield to increasing head load. The results show that heat stress reduced milk yield by 4.16% to 14.42% across THI groups, with daily milk yield being the highest in THI1 (7.40\u00b10.39 litres) and the lowest in THI4 (6.33\u00b10.32). Regression coefficients within groups showed significant daily milk yield decrease in THI2 (-0.09) and THI3 (-0.06), but not for other THI classes, indicating that cows experienced heat stress between THI values of 67 and 76 and milk loss plateaued afterwards, suggesting that the animals acclimatized to heat stress conditions beyond THI value of 76. At the population level, THI and its squared term were significantly negatively and positively (-0.61, 0.004) associated with milk production, indicating a non-linear relationship between milk yield and THI. The CSF model showed better goodness of fit and predictive ability than other models for predicting future population response of milk yield to heat stress in small holder dairy farms in Tanzania. Herd management strategies and animal husbandry measures are needed in small holder dairy farms in Tanzania to minimize the impact of heat stress on milk yield and income of the farmers."

        "abstract": "Background. The rumen microbiota contributes strongly to the degradation of ingested plant materials. There is limited knowledge about the diversity of taxa involved in the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomasses with varying chemical compositions in the rumen. Method. We aimed to assess how and to what extent the physicochemical properties of forages influence the colonization and digestion by rumen microbiota. This was achieved by placing nylon bags filled with candidate materials in the rumen of fistulated sheep for a period of up to 96 h, followed by measuring forage's chemical characteristics and community structure of biofilm-embedded microbiota. Results. Rumen degradation for all forages appeared to have occurred mainly during the first 24 h of their incubation, which significantly slowed down after 48 h of rumen incubation, depending on their chemical properties. Random Forest analysis predicted the predominant role of Treponema and Butyrivibrio in shaping microbial diversity attached to the forages during the course of rumen incubation. Exploring community structure and composition of fiber-attached microbiota revealed significant differential colonization rates of forages depending on their contents for NDF and cellulose. The correlation analysis highlighted the significant contribution of Lachnospiraceae and Veillonellaceae to fiber degradation in the sheep rumen. Conclusion. Our findings suggested that forage cellulose components are critical in shaping the pattern of microbial colonization and thus their final digestibility in the rumen."

        "abstract": "Pig herds in Africa comprise genotypes ranging from local ecotypes to commercial breeds. Many animals are composites of these two types and the best levels of crossbreeding for particular production systems are largely unknown. These pigs are managed without structured breeding programs and inbreeding is potentially limiting. The objective of this study was to quantify ancestry contributions and inbreeding levels in a population of smallholder pigs in Uganda. The study was set in the districts of Hoima and Kamuli in Uganda and involved 422 pigs. Pig hair samples were taken from adult and growing pigs in the framework of a longitudinal study investigating productivity and profitability of smallholder pig production. The samples were genotyped using the porcine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) 50K SNP Chip. The SNP data was analyzed to infer breed ancestry and autozygosity of the Uganda pigs. The results showed that exotic breeds (modern European and old British) contributed an average of 22.8% with a range of 2\u201350% while \u201clocal\u201d blood contributed 69.2% (36.9\u201395.2%) to the ancestry of the pigs. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) greater than 2 megabase (Mb) quantified the average genomic inbreeding coefficient of the pigs as 0.043. The scarcity of long ROH indicated low recent inbreeding. We conclude that the genomic background of the pig population in the study is a mix of old British and modern pig ancestries. Best levels of admixture for smallholder pigs are yet to be determined, by linking genotypes and phenotypic records."

        "abstract": "Increasing poultry product consumption trends have attracted researchers and development practitioners to look for interventions that transform the low-input low-output-based village chicken production to a high yielding production system. However, due to the intricate nature of the production system, there is a dearth of evidence that helps design comprehensive interventions at the smallholder level. Using national-level representative data collected from 3555 village chicken producers in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania, this study examines the technical efficiency of village chicken production and investigates the main factors that explain the level of inefficiency. We applied a stochastic frontier analysis to simultaneously quantify the level of technical efficiency and identify factors associated with heterogeneity in inefficiency. We found that the level of technical efficiency is extremely low in the three countries, suggesting enormous opportunities to enhance productivity using available resources. The heterogeneity in technical efficiency is strongly associated with producers\u2019 experience in breed improvements and flock management, limited technical knowledge and skills, limited access to institutions and markets, smaller flock size, gender disparities, and household livelihood orientation. We argue the need to adopt an integrated approach to enhance village producers\u2019 productivity and transform the traditional subsistence-based production system into a commercially oriented semi-intensive production system."

        "abstract": "Breeding for climate resilience is currently an important goal for sustainable livestock production. Local adaptations exhibited by indigenous livestock allow investigating the genetic control of this resilience. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) provides a powerful avenue to identify the main environmental drivers of selection. Here, we applied an integrative approach combining ENM with genome-wide selection signature analyses (XPEHH and Fst) and genotype\u2212environment association (redundancy analysis), with the aim of identifying the genomic signatures of adaptation in African village chickens. By dissecting 34 agro-climatic variables from the ecosystems of 25 Ethiopian village chicken populations, ENM identified six key drivers of environmental challenges: One temperature variable\u2014strongly correlated with elevation, three precipitation variables as proxies for water availability, and two soil\/land cover variables as proxies of food availability for foraging chickens. Genome analyses based on whole-genome sequencing (n = 245), identified a few strongly supported genomic regions under selection for environmental challenges related to altitude, temperature, water scarcity, and food availability. These regions harbor several gene clusters including regulatory genes, suggesting a predominantly oligogenic control of environmental adaptation. Few candidate genes detected in relation to heat-stress, indicates likely epigenetic regulation of thermo-tolerance for a domestic species originating from a tropical Asian wild ancestor. These results provide possible explanations for the rapid past adaptation of chickens to diverse African agro-ecologies, while also representing new landmarks for sustainable breeding improvement for climate resilience. We show that the pre-identification of key environmental drivers, followed by genomic investigation, provides a powerful new approach for elucidating adaptation in domestic animals."

        "abstract": "Corridor disease (CD) is a fatal condition of cattle caused by buffalo-derived Theileria parva. Unlike the related condition, East Coast fever (ECF), which results from infection with cattle-derived T. parva, CD has not been extensively studied. We describe in detail the clinical and laboratory findings in cattle naturally infected with buffalo-derived T. parva. Forty-six cattle were exposed to buffalo-derived T. parva under field conditions at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya, between 2013-2018. The first signs of disease observed in all animals were nasal discharge (mean day of onset 9 days post exposure), enlarged lymph nodes (10 days post exposure) and pyrexia (13.7 days post exposure). Coughing and laboured breathing were observed in over 50% of animals (14 days post exposure). Less commonly observed signs, corneal oedema (22%) and diarrhoea (11%), were observed later in the disease progression (19 days post exposure). All infections were considered clinically severe and forty-two animals succumbed to infection. The mean time to death across all studies was 18.4 days. The mean time from onset of clinical signs to death was 9 days and from pyrexia to death was 4.8 days indicating a relatively short duration of clinical illness. There were significant relationships between days to death and the days to first temperature (Chi2=4.00, p=0.046) and days to peak temperature (Chi2=25.81, p=0.001). These clinical indicators may be useful for assessing severity of disease in the future. All infections were confirmed by the presence of macroschizonts in lymph node biopsies (mean time to parasitosis was 11 days). Piroplasms were detected in the blood of two animals (4%) and 20 (43%) animals seroconverted. In this study we demonstrate the successful approach to an experimental field study for CD in cattle. We also describe the clinical progression of CD in naturally infected cattle including the onset and severity of clinical signs and pathology. Laboratory diagnoses based on examination of blood samples are unreliable and alternatives may not be available to cattle keepers. The rapid development of CD requires recognition of the clinical signs which may be useful for early diagnosis of the disease and effective intervention for affected animals."

        "abstract": "Species domestication is generally characterized by the exploitation of high-impact mutations through processes that involve complex shifting demographics of domesticated species. These include not only inbreeding and artificial selection that may lead to the emergence of evolutionary bottlenecks, but also post-divergence gene flow and introgression. Although domestication potentially affects the occurrence of both desired and undesired mutations, the way wild relatives of domesticated species evolve and how expensive the genetic cost underlying domestication is remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the demographic history and genetic load of chicken domestication. We analyzed a dataset comprising over 800 whole genomes from both indigenous chickens and wild jungle fowls. We show that despite having a higher genetic diversity than their wild counterparts (average \u03c0, 0.00326 vs. 0.00316), the red jungle fowls, the present-day domestic chickens experienced a dramatic population size decline during their early domestication. Our analyses suggest that the concomitant bottleneck induced 2.95% more deleterious mutations across chicken genomes compared with red jungle fowls, supporting the \u201ccost of domestication\u201d hypothesis. Particularly, we find that 62.4% of deleterious SNPs in domestic chickens are maintained in heterozygous states and masked as recessive alleles, challenging the power of modern breeding programs to effectively eliminate these genetic loads. Finally, we suggest that positive selection decreases the incidence but increases the frequency of deleterious SNPs in domestic chicken genomes. This study reveals a new landscape of demographic history and genomic changes associated with chicken domestication and provides insight into the evolutionary genomic profiles of domesticated animals managed under modern human selection."

        "abstract": "Rumen microbiota play a key role in the digestion and utilization of plant materials by the ruminant species, which have important implications for greenhouse gas emission. Yet, little is known about the key taxa and potential gene functions involved in the digestion process. Here, we performed a genome-centric analysis of rumen microbiota attached to six different lignocellulosic biomasses in rumen-fistulated cattle. Our metagenome sequencing provided novel genomic insights into functional potential of 523 uncultured bacteria and 15 mostly uncultured archaea in the rumen. The assembled genomes belonged mainly to Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobiota, and Fibrobacterota and were enriched for genes related to the degradation of lignocellulosic polymers and the fermentation of degraded products into short chain volatile fatty acids. We also found a shift from copiotrophic to oligotrophic taxa during the course of rumen fermentation, potentially important for the digestion of recalcitrant lignocellulosic substrates in the physiochemically complex and varying environment of the rumen. Differential colonization of forages (the incubated lignocellulosic materials) by rumen microbiota suggests that taxonomic and metabolic diversification is an evolutionary adaptation to diverse lignocellulosic substrates constituting a major component of the cattle\u2019s diet. Our data also provide novel insights into the key role of unique microbial diversity and associated gene functions in the degradation of recalcitrant lignocellulosic materials in the rumen."

        "abstract": "Matrilineal genetic diversity and relationship were investigated among eight morphologically identified native Ethiopian horse populations using polymorphisms in 46 mtDNA D-loop sequences (454 base pairs). The horse populations identified were Abyssinian, Bale, Borana, Horro, Kafa, Kundido feral horses, Ogaden and Selale. Mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequences were characterized by 15 variable sites that defined five different haplotypes. All genetic diversity estimates, including Reynolds&rsquo; linearized genetic distance, genetic differentiation (FST) and nucleotide sequence divergence (DA), revealed a low genetic differentiation in native Ethiopian horse populations. However, Kundido feral and Borana domestic horses were slightly diverged from the rest of the Ethiopian horse populations. We also tried to shed some light on the matrilineal genetic root of native Ethiopian horses from a network constructed by combining newly generated haplotypes and reference haplotypes deposited in the GenBank for Eurasian type Turkish Anatolian horses that were used as a genetic conduit between Eurasian and African horse populations. Ninety-two haplotypes were generated from the combined Ethio-Eurasian mtDNA D-loop sequences. A network reconstructed from the combined haplotypes using Median-Joining algorithm showed that haplotypes generated from native Ethiopian horses formed separate clusters. The present result encourages further investigation of the genetic origin of native African horses by retrieving additional mtDNA sequences deposited in the GenBank for African and Eurasian type horses."

        "abstract": "Although major advances in genomics have initiated an exciting new era of research, a lack of information regarding cis-regulatory elements has limited the genetic improvement or manipulation of pigs as a meat source and biomedical model. Here, we systematically characterize cis-regulatory elements and their functions in 12 diverse tissues from four pig breeds by adopting similar strategies as the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics\u00a0projects, which include RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq. In total, we generate 199 datasets and identify more than 220,000 cis-regulatory elements in the pig genome. Surprisingly, we find higher conservation of cis-regulatory elements between human and pig genomes than those between human and mouse genomes. Furthermore, the differences of topologically associating domains between the pig and human genomes are associated with morphological evolution of the head and face. Beyond generating a major new benchmark resource for pig epigenetics, our study provides basic comparative epigenetic data relevant to using pigs as models in human biomedical research. To date, little is known about the regulatory landscape of the pig genome. Here, the authors characterize cis-regulatory elements in the pig genome using RNA-seq, ChIP-Seq and ATAC-seq, finding a higher degree of usage conservation between pig and human than mouse and human."

        "abstract": "The identification of genome-wide selection signatures can provide insights on the mechanisms of natural and\/or artificial selection and uncover genes related to biological functions and\/or phenotypes. Tibetan sheep are an important livestock in Tibet, providing meat and wool for Tibetans who are renown for breeding livestock that adapt well to high altitudes. Using whole-genome sequences with an effective sequencing depth of 5\u00d7, we investigated the genomic diversity and structure and, identified selection signatures of White Tibetan, Oula and Poll Dorset sheep. We obtained 30,163,679 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 5,388,372 indels benchmarked against the ovine Oar_v4.0 genome assembly. Next, using FST, ZHp and XP-EHH approaches, we identified selection signatures spanning a set of candidate genes, including HIF1A, CAPN3, PRKAA1, RXFP2, TRHR and HOXA10 that are associated with pathways and GO categories putatively related to hypoxia responses, meat traits and disease resistance. Candidate genes and GO terms associated with coat color were also identified. Finally, quantification of blood physiological parameters, revealed higher levels of mean corpuscular hemoglobin measurement and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration in Tibetan sheep compared with Poll Dorset, suggesting a greater oxygen-carrying capacity in the Tibetan sheep and thus better adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. In conclusion, this study provides a greater understanding of genome diversity and variations associated with adaptive and production traits in sheep."

        "abstract": "The most prolific duck genetic resource in the world is located in Southeast\/South Asia but little is known about the domestication and complex histories of these duck populations. Based on whole-genome resequencing data of 78 ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 31 published whole-genome duck sequences, we detected three geographic distinct genetic groups, including local Chinese, wild, and local Southeast\/South Asian populations. We inferred the demographic history of these duck populations with different geographical distributions and found that the Chinese and Southeast\/South Asian ducks shared similar demographic features. The Chinese domestic ducks experienced the strongest population bottleneck caused by domestication and the last glacial maximum (LGM) period, whereas the Chinese wild ducks experienced a relatively weak bottleneck caused by domestication only. Furthermore, the bottleneck was more severe in the local Southeast\/South Asian populations than in the local Chinese populations, which resulted in a smaller effective population size for the former (7100\u201311,900). We show that extensive gene flow has occurred between the Southeast\/South Asian and Chinese populations, and between the Southeast Asian and South Asian populations. Prolonged gene flow was detected between the Guangxi population from China and its neighboring Southeast\/South Asian populations. In addition, based on multiple statistical approaches, we identified a genomic region that included three genes (PNPLA8, THAP5, and DNAJB9) on duck chromosome 1 with a high probability of gene flow between the Guangxi and Southeast\/South Asian populations. Finally, we detected strong signatures of selection in genes that are involved in signaling pathways of the nervous system development (e.g., ADCYAP1R1 and PDC) and in genes that are associated with morphological traits such as cell growth (e.g., IGF1R). Our findings provide valuable information for a better understanding of the domestication and demographic history of the duck, and of the gene flow between local duck populations from Southeast\/South Asia and China."

        "abstract": "We investigated the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of six morphologically distinct Ethiopian donkey populations using 12 equine microsatellite markers. The donkey populations were Abyssinian (AB), Afar (AF), Hararghe (HA), Ogaden (OG), Omo (OM) and Sinnar (SI). Blood samples were collected from 180 genetically unrelated donkeys (30 individuals per population). Population genetic diversity estimates showed that total number and mean number of observed alleles, average observed and expected heterozygosity were 94, 5.208 \u00b1 0.0229, 0.555 \u00b1 0.023 and 0.588 \u00b1 0.022, respectively. Highly significant deficiency in heterozygote was detected within the overall samples (FIS = 0.055 \u00b1 0.021; P < 0.001). Though highly significant (P < 0.001), heterozygote deficiency within populations relative to total population was moderate (FST = 0.046 \u00b1 0.016), suggesting a higher diversity within the populations (95.4%) than between populations. Various genetic distance estimation methods produced a similar topology of un-rooted dendrograms that grouped the overall Ethiopian donkeys into lowland (Ogaden, Omo and Sinnar) and highland (Abyssinian, Afar and Hararghe) genetic lineages. Likewise, Bayesian clustering analysis produced a similar pattern of clustering that was highly concordant with traditional donkey classification systems in Ethiopia."

        "abstract": "Background: A very little study has been conducted on the phylogenetic diversity of Nepalese indigenous goats where four breeds, Khari, Chyangra, Terai and Sinhal, have been identified.\u00a0Methods: The 625-bp long sequences of the mitochondrial DNA hyper-variable region obtained from 93 goats in this study revealed high haplotype diversity among breeds, which come under four haplogroups (A-D).Result: The study demonstrated a certain level of gene flow among the neighboring goat populations exhibiting no correspondence between the geographic regions of origin and relationships among breeds. The complex mtDNA diversity and structure identified among indigenous Nepalese goats can be explained by gene flow through ancient trading and the current \u2018free\u2019 movement of goats across the geographic vicinities in India and China. Furthermore, HapG B showed the southward direction of gene flow which does not cross the Himalayas, whereas HapG B1 revealed the South-West gene flow from the claimed domestication center for HapG B, China, to Nepal."

        "abstract": "The application of high-throughput genotyping or sequencing data helps us to understand the genomic response to natural and artificial selection. In this study,we scanned the genomes of five indigenous buffalo populations belong to three recognized breeds, adapted to different geographical and agro-ecological zones in Iran, to unravel the extent of genomic diversity and to localize genomic regions and genes underwent past selection. A total of 46 river buffalo whole genomes, from West and East Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Khuzestan provinces, were resequenced. Our sequencing data reached to a coverage above 99%of the river buffalo reference genome and an average read depth around 9.2\u00d7 per sample. We identified 20.55 million SNPs, including 63,097 missense, 707 stop-gain, and 159 stop-lossmutations thatmight have functional consequences. Genomic diversity analyses showed modest structuring among Iranian buffalo populations following frequent gene flow or admixture in the recent past. Evidence of positive selection was investigated using both differentiation (Fst) and fixation (Pi)metrics. Analysis of fixation revealed three genomic regions in all three breeds with aberrant polymorphism contents on BBU2, 20, and 21. Fixation signal on BBU2 overlapped with the OCA2-HERC2 genes, suggestive of adaptation to UV exposure through pigmentation mechanism. Further validation using resequencing data from other five bovine species as well as the Axiom Buffalo Genotyping Array 90K data of river and swampbuffaloes indicated that these fixation signals persisted across river and swampbuffaloes and extended to taurine cattle, implying an ancient evolutionary event occurred before the speciation of buffalo and taurine cattle. These results contributed to our understanding of major genetic switches that took place during the evolution of modern buffaloes."

        "abstract": "Improved climate-resilient strains of indigenous sheep and goats were introduced in the Nyando basin of western Kenya in 2013. This study evaluated the performance of the breeds five years after their first introduction, and their contribution to household revenues. Red Maasai and Red Maasai x Dorper sheep and Galla goats introduced in Nyando adapted to the environment and retained performance levels exhibited in their original environments. They have been widely adopted by the farmers and are used for upgrading local breeds through crossbreeding, yielding offspring that are 50% heavier than local breeds at one year of age. Costs for producing the small ruminants tend to increase with land size owned, mainly due to higher costs for managing the health of more livestock. The costs of producing goats are significantly higher than for sheep. Revenues accrued from goat milk contribute to 10% of the revenue from goats. The introduced breeds provided a significant productivity lift in the local livestock population, resulting in higher returns to the smallholder farmers. For long-term sustainability of the productivity gains, a community-based selective mating program using reference sire flocks with an overall goal of good growth, adaptability, and milk production should be adopted."

        "abstract": "East Coast fever (ECF) in cattle is caused by the Apicomplexan protozoan Theileria parva, transmitted by the three-host tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is the natural host for T. parva but does not suffer disease, whereas ECF is often fatal in cattle. The genetic relationship between T. parva populations circulating in cattle and buffalo is poorly understood, and has not been studied in sympatric buffalo and cattle. The study aimed to determine the genetic diversity of the T. parva population in cattle and buffalo, in an area where livestock co-exist with buffalo adjacent to the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Three T. parva antigens known to be recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in immunized cattle, were used to characterize genetic diversity in T. parva in cattle (n=149) and buffalo samples (n=22). Long read (Pacbio) sequencing was used to generate full or near-full length allelic sequences. Patterns of diversity were similar across all three antigens, with allelic diversity being significantly greater in buffalo-derived parasites compared to cattle-derived (e.g. for Tp1 median cattle allele count was 9, and 81.5 for buffalo), with very few alleles shared between species (8 of 651 alleles were shared for Tp1). Most alleles were unique to buffalo with a smaller proportion unique to cattle (412 buffalo unique vs 231 cattle-unique for Tp1). There were indications of population substructuring, with one allelic cluster of Tp1 representing alleles found in both cattle and buffalo (including the TpM reference genome allele), and another containing predominantly only alleles deriving from buffalo. These data illustrate the complex interplay between T. parva populations in buffalo and cattle, revealing the significant genetic diversity in the buffalo T. parva population, the limited sharing of parasite genotypes between the host species, and highlight that a subpopulation of T. parva is maintained by transmission within cattle. The data indicate that fuller understanding of buffalo T. parva population dynamics is needed, as only a comprehensive understanding of the population genetics of T. parva populations will enable assessment of buffalo-derived infection risk in cattle, and how this may impact upon control measures such as vaccination."

        "abstract": "Chicken is the most numerous among the domesticated livestock species. Across cultures, religions, and societies, chicken is widely accepted with little or no taboo compared to other domestic animals. Its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions and demonstrated potential for breeding improvement provide a unique genetic resource for addressing the challenges of food security in a world impacted by climatic change and human population growth. Recent studies, shedding new knowledge on the chicken genomes, have helped reconstruct its past evolutionary history. Here, we review the literature concerning the origin, dispersion, and adaptation of domestic chicken. We highlight the role of human and natural selection in shaping the diversity of the species and provide a few examples of knowledge gaps that may be the focus of future research."

        "abstract": "<p> Several studies have evaluated computational methods that infer the haplotypes from population genotype data in European cattle populations. However, little is known about how well they perform in African indigenous and crossbred populations. This study investigates: (1) global and local ancestry inference; (2) heterozygosity proportion estimation; and (3) genotype imputation in West African indigenous and crossbred cattle populations. Principal component analysis (PCA), ADMIXTURE, and LAMP-LD were used to analyse a medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset from Senegalese crossbred cattle. Reference SNP data of East and West African indigenous and crossbred cattle populations were used to investigate the accuracy of imputation from low to medium-density and from medium to high-density SNP datasets using Minimac v3. The first two principal components differentiated <italic>Bos indicus<\/italic> from European <italic>Bos taurus<\/italic> and African <italic>Bos taurus<\/italic> from other breeds. Irrespective of assuming two or three ancestral breeds for the Senegalese crossbreds, breed proportion estimates from ADMIXTURE and LAMP-LD showed a high correlation ( <italic>r<\/italic> \u2265 0.981). The observed ancestral origin heterozygosity proportion in putative F1 crosses was close to the expected value of 1.0, and clearly differentiated F1 from all other crosses. The imputation accuracies (estimated as correlation) between imputed and the real data in crossbred animals ranged from 0.142 to 0.717 when imputing from low to medium-density, and from 0.478 to 0.899 for imputation from medium to high-density. The imputation accuracy was generally higher when the reference data came from the same geographical region as the target population, and when crossbred reference data was used to impute crossbred genotypes. The lowest imputation accuracies were observed for indigenous breed genotypes. This study shows that ancestral origin heterozygosity can be estimated with high accuracy and will be far superior to the use of observed individual heterozygosity for estimating heterosis in African crossbred populations. It was not possible to achieve high imputation accuracy in West African crossbred or indigenous populations based on reference data sets from East Africa, and population-specific genotyping with high-density SNP assays is required to improve imputation. <\/p>"

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine breeding objectives and the impact of production systems and breed types on dairy cattle performance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A total of 64 research studies published between 1980 and 2018 were used for qualitative analysis (qualitative synthesis) of farmers\u2019, scientists\u2019 and institutional dairy trait preferences. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine the production and reproduction performance of dairy cattle in smallholder and large-scale dairy production systems. Most data used were from smallholder farmers (60%), with the remainder from large-scale farms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to estimate marginal means of production and reproduction traits for different breed types in both production systems. Overall, the results showed that there was a higher emphasis on breeding for improved fertility, increased milk yield and disease resistance. Milk content (fat and protein percentages), temperament, body conformation and total milk cell count (a mastitis indicator) were rarely mentioned in published literature, mainly because of milk pricing policies being volume based. Frequency and multivariate analyses (cluster data analysis) for desirable animal traits suggested that multiple breeding objectives are needed, based on the perceived goals of different farmers and institutions towards genetic improvement for production, reproduction, disease resistance and functional and animal welfare traits. Regardless of the breed type, commercial large-scale farms had a higher milk yield (2857.0 \u00b1 233.3) compared with smallholder dairy farms (2419.8 \u00b1 617.39). Estimated marginal means for lactation milk yield of the three breed types Holstein-Friesian, non-Holstein-Friesian dairy breeds (Jersey, Guernsey, Red Dane, Brown Swiss and Ayrshire) and cross-breds (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) were 3148.5 \u00b1 433.00, 2995.6 \u00b1 456.36 and 1771.1 \u00b1 328.52, respectively. Significantly shorter age at first calving and shorter calving intervals were observed in large-scale farms in comparison to smallholder farms (p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted for age at first calving, calving interval, days open and number of services per conception between the breed types. In conclusion, the present study suggests that (i) improvement of dairy cattle has focused on reproduction, production and disease resistance traits, reflecting the breeding objectives of farmers, scientists and institutions involved in dairy production; (ii) genetics plays a large role in increased dairy productivity in SSA and (iii) future dairy research should emphasise on the interactions between improved feeding, disease control and genetics at a production level to inform profitable combinations of dairy traits."

        "abstract": "Background: Understanding the relationship between genetic admixture and phenotypic performance is crucial for the optimization of crossbreeding programs. The use of small sets of informative ancestry markers can be a cost-effective option for the estimation of breed composition and for parentage assignment in situations where pedigree recording is difficult. The objectives of this study were to develop small single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels that can accurately estimate the total dairy proportion and assign parentage in both West and East African crossbred dairy cows. Methods: Medium-and high-density SNP genotype data (Illumina BovineSNP50 and BovineHD Beadchip) for 4231 animals sampled from African crossbreds, African Bos taurus, European Bos taurus, Bos indicus, and African indigenous populations were used. For estimating breed composition, the absolute differences in allele frequency were calculated between pure ancestral breeds to identify SNPs with the highest discriminating power, and different combinations of SNPs weighted by ancestral origin were tested against estimates based on all available SNPs. For parentage assignment, informative SNPs were selected based on the highest minor allele frequency (MAF) in African crossbred populations assuming two Scenarios: (1) parents were selected among all the animals with known genotypes, and (2) parents were selected only among the animals known to be a parent of at least one progeny. Results: For the medium-density genotype data, SNPs selected for the largest differences in allele frequency between West African indigenous and European Bos taurus breeds performed best for most African crossbred populations and achieved a prediction accuracy (r 2) for breed composition of 0.926 to 0.961 with 200 SNPs. For the high-density dataset, a panel with 70% of the SNPs selected on their largest difference in allele frequency between African and European Bos taurus performed best or very near best across all crossbred populations with r 2 ranging from 0.978 to 0.984 with 200 SNPs. In all African crossbred populations, unambiguous parentage assignment was possible with \u2265 300 SNPs for the majority of the panels for Scenario 1 and \u2265 200 SNPs for Scenario 2. Conclusions: The identified low-cost SNP assays could overcome incomplete or inaccurate pedigree records in African smallholder systems and allow effective breeding decisions to produce progeny of desired breed composition."

        "abstract": "<p>Livestock keepers in southwestern Burkina Faso hold the local Lobi taurine breed, local Zebu cattle, and their crosses. Some communities in the region have begun to implement community-based cattle breeding programs (CBBPs), which involve animal tagging and recording and, potentially, also bull sharing. Based on the hypothesis that the participation of livestock keepers in CBBPs depends on their attitudes towards these programs, we used questionnaires to survey the attitudes of 125 farmers towards cattle breeding strategies and tools. Results were analyzed using principal component analysis. Farmers showed a highly positive attitude towards maintaining the features of their preferred cattle breed, but their attitudes varied substantially towards crossbreeding for breed improvement. Farmers generally agreed that performance was more important than animal appearance, and most of them were willing to cooperate with breeders\u2019 associations but were skeptical about sharing their bulls with other farmers. The majority was reluctant to record performance data, which may be due to a capacity deficit and their confidence in being able to select the best animals based purely on phenotype. Our analysis suggests that breeders\u2019 associations, as a key component of CBBPs, should lay down clear rules and obligations for their members from the outset. Timely consideration of farmers\u2019 attitudes towards different breeding tools may improve their uptake and guarantee the sustainability of CBBPs.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "High-throughput genomic markers provide an opportunity to assess important indicators of genetic diversity for populations managed in livestock breeding programs. While well-structured breeding programs are common in developed countries, in developing country situations, especially in West Africa, on-farm performance and pedigree recordings are rare, and thus, genomic markers provide insights to the levels of genetic diversity, inbreeding and introgression by other breeds. In this study, we analysed key population parameters such as population structure, admixture and levels of inbreeding in three neighbouring populations of African taurine and taurine \u00d7 Zebu crosses managed by community-based breeding programs in the South-West of Burkina Faso. The three populations were pure Baoul\u00e9 (called Lobi locally) in sedentary production systems, Baoul\u00e9 x Zebu crossbreds in sedentary systems and Zebu\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Baoul\u00e9 crossbreds in transhumant production systems, respectively. The total sample analysed included 631 animals and 38,207 single nucleotide polymorphisms after quality control. Results of principal component and admixture analyses confirmed the genetic background of two distinct ancestral populations (taurine and zebuine) and levels of admixture in all three breeding populations, including the presumably pure Baoul\u00e9 group of animals. Inbreeding levels were moderate, compared to European dairy and beef cattle populations and higher than those of Brazilian Nellore cattle. Very few animals with inbreeding levels indicating parent\u2013offspring or full sib mating were observed, and inbreeding levels indicating half sib mating were also rare. For the management of breeding populations, farmers were advised to exchange best young bulls. The crossbreeding levels of presumably pure Baoul\u00e9 animals are of concern to the breeding program due to the high level of endangerment of pure African taurine cattle populations across West Africa. Future rounds of bull selection in the community-based breeding program will make use of genomic information about admixture levels."

        "abstract": "Understanding the genetic structure of adaptation and productivity in challenging environments is necessary for designing breeding programs that suit such conditions. Crossbred dairy cattle in East Africa resulting from over 60 years of crossing exotic dairy breeds with indigenous cattle plus inter se matings form a highly variable admixed population. This population has been subject to natural selection in response to environmental stresses, such as harsh climate, low-quality feeds, poor management, and strong disease challenge. Here, we combine two complementary sets of analyses, genome-wide association (GWA) and signatures of selection (SoS), to identify genomic regions that contribute to variation in milk yield and\/or contribute to adaptation in admixed dairy cattle of Kenya. Our GWA separates SNP effects due to ancestral origin of alleles from effects due to within-population linkage disequilibrium. The results indicate that many genomic regions contributed to the high milk production potential of modern dairy breeds with no region having an exceptional effect. For SoS, we used two haplotype-based tests to compare haplotype length variation within admixed and between admixed and East African Shorthorn Zebu cattle populations. The integrated haplotype score (iHS) analysis identified 16 candidate regions for positive selection in the admixed cattle while the between population Rsb test detected 24 divergently selected regions in the admixed cattle compared to East African Shorthorn Zebu. We compare the results from GWA and SoS in an attempt to validate the most significant SoS results. Only four candidate regions for SoS intersect with GWA regions using a low stringency test. The identified SoS candidate regions harbored genes in several enriched annotation clusters and overlapped with previously found QTLs and associations for different traits in cattle. If validated, the GWA and SoS results indicate potential for SNP-based genomic selection for genetic improvement of smallholder crossbred cattle."

        "abstract": "<p>Cattle are one of the most important livestock species in West Africa, providing multiple services to farmers and contributing to national economies. Various breeding strategies have been implemented to enhance their productivity and have improved farmer livelihoods. This review describes cattle breeding experiences across West Africa, spanning the N\u2019Dama breed in Mali, Senegal, and The Gambia to the breeds Azawak Zebu, Fulani Zebu, and taurine Baoul\u00e9 in Burkina Faso. The main objectives of most breeding programs have been to optimize meat and milk performance of taurine and Zebu cattle as well as trypanotolerance of taurine cattle. In some cases, \u201cclosed nucleus\u201d schemes have proven limited and so have evolved into \u201copen nucleus\u201d schemes. Recent community-based breeding programs have shown promise. The major challenges of breeding programs remain defining realistic breeding objectives and securing the involvement of stakeholders. All the strategies reviewed here have been funded externally within development or research projects that are often too short to yield tangible genetic improvement, and whether they will continue beyond those projects is uncertain. This review highlights the need for continuing government support to ensure the sustainability of local cattle breeding programs.<\/p>"

Here, through whole-genome sequence analysis of 172 indigenous African cattle from 16 breeds representative of the main cattle groups, we identify a major taurine \u00d7 indicine cattle admixture event dated to circa 750\u20131,050 yr ago, which has shaped the genome of today\u2019s cattle in the Horn of Africa. We identify 16 loci linked to African environmental adaptations across crossbred animals showing an excess of taurine or indicine ancestry. These include immune-, heat-tolerance- and reproduction-related genes. Moreover, we identify one highly divergent locus in African taurine cattle, which is putatively linked to trypanotolerance and present in crossbred cattle living in trypanosomosis-infested areas. Our findings indicate that a combination of past taurine and recent indicine admixture-derived genetic resources is at the root of the present success of African pastoralism."

        "abstract": "Poultry play an important role in the agriculture of many African countries. The majority of chickens in sub-Saharan Africa are indigenous, raised in villages under semi-scavenging conditions. Vaccinations and biosecurity measures rarely apply, and infectious diseases remain a major cause of mortality and reduced productivity. Genomic selection for disease resistance offers a potentially sustainable solution but this requires sufficient numbers of individual birds with genomic and phenotypic data, which is often a challenge to collect in the small populations of indigenous chicken ecotypes. The use of information across-ecotypes presents an attractive possibility to increase the relevant numbers and the accuracy of genomic selection. In this study, we performed a joint analysis of two distinct Ethiopian indigenous chicken ecotypes to investigate the genomic architecture of important health and productivity traits and explore the feasibility of conducting genomic selection across-ecotype. Phenotypic traits considered were antibody response to Infectious Bursal Disease (IBDV), Marek's Disease (MDV), Fowl Cholera (PM) and Fowl Typhoid (SG), resistance to Eimeria and cestode parasitism, and productivity [body weight and body condition score (BCS)]. Combined data from the two chicken ecotypes, Horro (n = 384) and Jarso (n = 376), were jointly analyzed for genetic parameter estimation, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genomic breeding value (GEBVs) calculation, genomic predictions, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and pathways analyses. Estimates of across-ecotype heritability were significant and moderate in magnitude (0.22-0.47) for all traits except for SG and BCS. GWAS identified several significant genomic associations with health and productivity traits. The WGS analysis revealed putative candidate genes and mutations for IBDV (TOLLIP, ANGPTL5, BCL9, THEMIS2), MDV (GRM7), SG (MAP3K21), Eimeria (TOM1L1) and Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 1 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 543890 Banos et al. Breeding for Resistance Against Infectious Disease cestodes (TNFAIP1, ATG9A, NOS2) parasitism, which warrant further investigation. Reliability of GEBVs increased compared to within-ecotype calculations but accuracy of genomic prediction did not, probably because the genetic distance between the two ecotypes offset the benefit from increased sample size. However, for some traits genomic prediction was only feasible in across-ecotype analysis. Our results generally underpin the potential of genomic selection to enhance health and productivity across-ecotypes. Future studies should establish the required minimum sample size and genetic similarity between ecotypes to ensure accurate joint genomic selection."

        "abstract": "Genomic regions subjected to selection frequently show signatures such as within-population reduced nucleotide diversity and outlier values of differentiation among differentially selected populations. In this study, we analyzed 50K SNP genotype data of 373 animals belonging to 23 sheep breeds of different geographic origins using the Rsb (extended haplotype homozygosity) and FST statistical approaches, to identify loci associated with the fat-tail phenotype. We also checked if these putative selection signatures overlapped with regions of high-homozygosity (ROH). The analyses identified novel signals and confirmed the presence of selection signature in genomic regions that harbor candidate genes known to affect fat deposition. Several genomic regions that frequently appeared in ROH were also identified within each breed, but only two ROH islands overlapped with the putative selection signatures. The results reported herein provide the most complete genome-wide study of selection signatures for fat-tail in African and Eurasian sheep breeds; they also contribute insights into the genetic basis for the fat tail phenotype in sheep, and confirm the great complexity of the mechanisms that underlie quantitative traits, such as the fat-tail."

        "abstract": "Despite the substantial role that chickens have played in human societies across the world, both the geographic and temporal origins of their domestication remain controversial. To address this issue, we analyzed 863 genomes from a worldwide sampling of chickens and representatives of all four species of wild jungle fowl and each of the five subspecies of red jungle fowl (RJF). Our study suggests that domestic chickens were initially derived from the RJF subspecies Gallus gallus spadiceus whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar. Following their domestication, chickens were translocated across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred locally with both RJF subspecies and other jungle fowl species. In addition, our results show that the White Leghorn chicken breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from other subspecies of RJF. Despite the strong episodic gene flow from geographically divergent lineages of jungle fowls, our analyses show that domestic chickens undergo genetic adaptations that underlie their unique behavioral, morphological and reproductive traits. Our study provides novel insights into the evolutionary history of domestic chickens and a valuable resource to facilitate ongoing genetic and functional investigations of the world\u2019s most numerous domestic animal."

        "abstract": "Traditional livestock husbandry is of great socio-economic importance for farmers and pastoral populations in Burkina Faso in general and in particular, those in the Southwestern region. The aim of our study is to inventory medicinal plants in cattle husbandry in the Poni province. Methodology consisted of semi-structured interviews; individual conversations with local specialists in the use of local plants. A total of 120 informants were interviewed (60 specialists, 60 non-specialist farmers) across three sites (Bouroum\u2013Bouroum, Lorop\u00e9ni and Kampti) where a community based cattle breeding program has taken place. The results showed that 26 medicinal plants for veterinary use, distributed across 23 genera and 15 families were well known. In total, 9 important cattle diseases for which medicinal plants are used have been recorded. The most frequent diseases reported were foot and mouth disease (22%) and animal trypanosomosis (21%). Among the six (06) modes of preparation recorded for disease treatment, decoction was the most used (62%). Statistical analyses revealed a significant difference between men and women (p = 0.002) with medicinal plant knowledge. Men know more medicinal plants than women do. The results have indicated a disparity of medicinal plant knowledge according to age classes. The results also revealed a significant difference (p = 0.028) of plants recognised by seven ethnic groups. Knowledge of different medicinal plants for veterinary use among the ethnic groups was influenced by the family income source and the main activity. The informant consensus factor (0.5) showed that all the informants agreed on the importance of medicinal plant conservation. Promoting the veterinary use of the plants recorded in this study could be a key to their conservation."

        "abstract": "Improved Awassi sheep from Israel has been used for the improvement of the productivity of Ethiopian short-fat tailed Menz and Wollo sheep breeds through crossbreeding. High density (~50,000) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers distributed along the ovine genome were analyzed for Menz (n = =34), Wollo (n = =18), local Awassi (n = =24) and improved Awassi (n = =23) sheep breeds to assess genetic diversity and population structure. Proportion of polymorphism was highest for local Awassi (96.2%) followed by the Ethiopian breeds (91.7 to 93.0%). Lowest proportion of polymorphic SNP was found in improved Awassi (84.3%). Expected heterozygosity was high (0.37) for local Awassi followed by the local Ethiopian breeds (0.35 and 0.36) and the improved Awassi (0.35). Highest genetic differentiation measured as fixation index (FST) appeared between local Ethiopian breeds and improved Awassi (FST ~ 0.14) while the two Ethiopian breeds were closely related (FST=0.004). Surprisingly, local Awassi sheep differentiated from improved Awassi at a higher level (FST = 0.09) than it differentiated from Wollo (FST = 0.058) and Menz (FST = 0.065). Principal component, model based structure and neighbor net analysis revealed clustering of populations according to their geographic location and breed development history. Strong selection pressure on the Awassi sheep resulted in significant differentiation from local Awassi, less within population variation, excess monomorphic loci and high level of runs of homozygosity (ROH) based genomic inbreeding. The high level of differentiation between local Ethiopian and improved Awassi supported the use of improved Awassi sheep to improve Menz and Wollo sheep breeds. However, importation of Awassi sheep and mating should consider strategies of controlling the level of inbreeding."

Technological advances in earth observation have made tools available that enable identification and mapping livestock species that are at risk of exposure to heat stress due to climate change. Here, we present a methodology to map the current and likely future heat stress risk in pigs using R software by combining the effects of temperature and relative humidity. We applied the method to growing-finishing pigs in Uganda. We mapped monthly heat stress risk and quantified the number of pigs exposed to heat stress using 18 global circulation models and projected impacts in the 2050s. Results show that more than 800\u00a0000 pigs in Uganda will be affected by heat stress in the future. The results can feed into evidence-based policy, planning and targeted resource allocation in the livestock sector.<\/p>"

In contrast, Blackhead Somali sheep (BHS, fat-rumped) thrive well in arid and semi-arid areas characterized by high temperature and low precipitation. The genomic investigation of Ethiopian sheep populations may help to identify genes and biological pathways enable to adapt to the different ecological conditions."

        "abstract": "This study assessed the feasibility of across-country genetic evaluation of dairy cattle in sub-Saharan Africa where data on livestock production are scarce. Genetic parameters were estimated for the 305-day milk yield in the first lactation and across five lactations, for age at first calving and for interval between first and second calving. Estimated breeding values of individual animals for these traits were calculated. There were records from 2 333, 25 208, and 5 929 Holstein cows in Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, and 898 and 65134 Jersey cows from Kenya and South Africa. Genetic gain from sire selection within and across countries. was predicted Genetic links between countries were determined from sires with daughters that had records in two or more countries, and from common ancestral sires across seven generations on both the maternal and paternal sides of the pedigree. Each country was treated as a trait in the across-country evaluation. The results showed that genetic variance and heritability were not always estimable within country, but were significantly different from zero in the across-country evaluation. In all three countries, there was greater genetic gain in all traits from an across-country genetic evaluation owing to greater accuracy of selection compared with within country. Kenya stood to benefit most from an across-country evaluation, followed by Zimbabwe, then South Africa. An across-country breeding programme using joint genetic evaluation would be feasible, provided that there were genetic links across countries, and would provide a platform for accelerated genetic progress through selection and germplasm exchange between sub-Saharan African countries."

The application of information and communications technology, mobile phones, and other digital innovations has shown some promising results but reliable internet connectivity still poses a challenge. Animal scientists will need to collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to design the next generation of innovative technologies which are cheap, robust, easy to use, and can function without internet connectivity for effcient capture of performance data in Sub-Saharan Africa. Application of emerging technologies will be critical to attracting youth into agriculture in developing countries and thus ensuring sustainable phenomics platforms."

        "abstract": "African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a tsetse-transmitted protozoan disease endemic in \"the tsetse belt\" of Africa. Past studies investigating the epidemiology of the disease rarely focused on spatial distribution when reporting the prevalence. The challenge of understanding the spatial epidemiology of the disease is further confounded by low-sensitive parasitological techniques used in field investigations. This study aimed to identify trypanosome species in cattle and their spatial distribution in western Kenya. Low-sensitive microscopic analysis and highly-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were also compared to better understand the epidemiology of Trypanosoma infections by use of the geographical information system (GIS). Blood samples from 888 cattle, collected between August 2010 and July 2012, were examined for Trypanosoma parasites by light microscopy and PCR. The spatial distribution of Trypanosoma positive cases by species were mapped and overlaid on the map for tsetse distribution. The estimated prevalence was 4.17% by PCR compared to 2.48% by microscopy. Trypanosomes were detected in tsetse free areas. Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma b. brucei were identified, but not the zoonotic Trypanosoma b. rhodesiense. This study demonstrated the importance of geospatial data analysis to understand the epidemiology of the parasite, to inform future research and formulate control strategies."

        "abstract": "Community-based breeding programs (CBBPs) for small ruminants have been suggested as alternatives to centralised, government-controlled breeding schemes which have been implemented in many developing countries. An innovative methodological framework on how to design, implement and sustain CBBPs was tested in three sites in Ethiopia: Bonga, Horro and Menz. In these CBBPs, the main selection trait identified through participatory approaches was 6-month weight in all three sites. In Horro and Bonga, where resources such as feed and water permitted larger litter sizes, twinning rate was included. Ten-year (2009 to 2018) performance data from the breeding programs were analysed using Average Information Restricted Maximum Likelihood method (AI-REML). Additionally, the socioeconomic impact of CBBPs was assessed. Results indicated that 6-month weight increased over the years in all breeds. In Bonga, the average increase was 0.21 \u00b1 0.018 kg\/year, followed by 0.18 \u00b1 0.007 and 0.11 \u00b1 0.003 kg\/year in Horro and Menz, respectively. This was quite substantial in an on-farm situation. The birth weight of lambs did not improve over the years in Bonga and Horro sheep but significant increases occurred in Menz. Considering that there was no direct selection on birth weight in the community flock, the increased weights observed in Menz could be due to correlated responses, but this was not the case in Bonga and Horro. The genetic trend for prolificacy over the years in both Bonga and Horro flocks was positive and significant (P < 0.01). This increase in litter size, combined with the increased 6-month body weight, increased income by 20% and farm-level meat consumption from slaughter of one sheep per year to three. The results show that CBBPs are technically feasible, result in measurable genetic gains in performance traits and impact the livelihoods of farmers."

        "abstract": "Smallholder dairy farmers have the challenges of accessing timely and reliable agricultural information, and this limits them from realizing maximum farm output. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) as a farming extension tool by smallholder farmers has the potential to reverse the scenario and improve farmers&rsquo; outputs and incomes leading to increased welfare. This study employed the Propensity score Matching approach to evaluate the impacts of ICT-based extension services, in this case, iCow services on milk production, milk income, and household income using cross-sectional data from a survey of dairy farmers in Uasin Gishu, Nyandarua and Bomet counties of Kenya. The use of ICT-based iCow services is shown to increase Annual milk production per cow, milk income, and household income by 13%, 29%, and 22%, respectively. Partnerships between network providers and research institutes should be encouraged as part of bridging the extension gap occasioned by reduced public expenditure on extension services."

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper was to evaluate the productivity of three indigenous goat breeds from Ethiopia namely Abergelle (AB), Central Highland (CH) and Woyto-Guji (WG) based on their kids\u2019 total live weight at three months (LWW), survival rate to three months (S3M) and average daily milk yield (ADM, for AB only). The LWW were standardized by year and post partum weight (ppw) of does. In addition, productivities expressed as the body weight of three months old kids produced per doe per year (index I) and per kg ppw per year (Index II) were also assessed. The overall least squares means of LWW for AB, CH and WG were 7.6, 15.3 and 10.2 kg, respectively. The overall mean of the ADM for AB was 367.10\u00b1139.79 ml. The S3M was 76.30%, 78.50% and 77.70%, for AB, CH and WG, respectively. Overall means of index I and index II were 14.7 kg and 0.50, respectively. Year of birth affected (p<0.05) LWW and S3M of AB, CH and WG as well as the indices. The ADM and S3M of AB and LWW of WG were also influenced ( p<0.001) by village of kidding. The LWW and S3M of the three breeds were not influenced (p>0.05) by sex of lambs. On the other hand parity of birth had clear influence (p<0.05) on ADM and S3M of AB and index I. Season of birth also had influence (p <0.001) on LWW of AB only. The CH does produce about 200% LWW of AB does and about 150% LWW of WG does. The CH was found to be the most productive breed in terms of all assessed parameters followed by WG. The AB was best suited for dual services (meat and milk). Hence, goat meat investment priorities in Ethiopia could target Central Highland goats. However, the productivity of these goat breeds should be improved in their respective localities by minimizing possible factors hampering their productivity."

        "abstract": "Background Ethiopian sheep living in different climatic zones and having contrasting morphologies are a most promising subject of molecular-genetic research. Elucidating their genetic diversity and genetic structure is critical for designing appropriate breeding and conservation strategies. Objective The study was aimed to investigate genome-wide genetic diversity and population structure of eight Ethiopian sheep populations. Methods A total of 115 blood samples were collected from four Ethiopian sheep populations that include Washera, Farta and Wollo (short fat-tailed) and Horro (long fat-tailed). DNA was extracted using Quick-DNA\u2122 Miniprep plus kit. All DNA samples were genotyped using Ovine 50 K SNP BeadChip. To infer genetic relationships of Ethiopian sheep at national, continental and global levels, genotype data on four Ethiopian sheep (Adilo, Arsi-Bale, Menz and Black Head Somali) and sheep from east, north, and south Africa, Middle East and Asia were included in the study as reference. Results Mean genetic diversity of Ethiopian sheep populations ranged from 0.352 \u00b1 0.14 for Horro to 0.379 \u00b1 0.14 for Arsi-Bale sheep. Population structure and principal component analyses of the eight Ethiopian indigenous sheep revealed four distinct genetic cluster groups according to their tail phenotype and geographical distribution. The short fat-tailed sheep did not represent one genetic cluster group. Ethiopian fat-rump sheep share a common genetic background with the Kenyan fat-tailed sheep. Conclusion The results of the present study revealed the principal component and population structure follows a clear pattern of tail morphology and phylogeography. There is clear signature of admixture among the study Ethiopian sheep populations"

        "abstract": "Assessments of production parameters and flock productivity were made in three indigenous goat breeds of Ethiopia. The goat breeds included Abergelle (AB), Central Highland (CH) and Woyto-Guji (WG). Objectives of this work were to estimate production parameters including three month weight (3mw), kidding intervals (KI) and litter size (LSB) at birth for the breeds and to assess their productivity at flock level that could be used as benchmark for evaluation of genetic progress to be realized. As AB is used for milk production, adjustment was made to their 3mw. The overall mean of 3mw (kg) were 7.44, 10.96 and 9.38 for AB, CH and WG goat breeds, respectively. Generally, wet season, male sex and single birth resulted in higher 3mw for three breeds. The overall means of KI were 362, 268 and 309 days for the breeds in respective order. The overall means of the LSB for the goat breeds, in respective order, were 1.03, 1.40 and 1.09 per doe per parturition. The flock productivity ranged from 0.27 to 0.53. Higher LSB, survival to three months (S3M), 3mw and number of parturition per year (N) resulted in higher flock productivity. CH goat breed had the highest flock productivity. The parameters estimated in this paper could be used as benchmarks for the designed CBBP of goats in the studied localities."

        "abstract": "African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is caused by a protozoan parasite that affects the health of livestock. Livestock production in Ethiopia is severely hampered by AAT and various controlling measures were not successful to eradicate the disease. AAT affects the indigenous breeds in varying degrees. However, the Sheko breed shows better trypanotolerance than other breeds. The tolerance attributes of Sheko are believed to be associated with its taurine genetic background but the genetic controls of these tolerance attributes of Sheko are not well understood. In order to investigate the level of taurine background in the genome, we compare the genome of Sheko with that of 11 other African breeds. We find that Sheko has an admixed genome composed of taurine and indicine ancestries. We apply three methods: (i) The integrated haplotype score (iHS), (ii) the standardized log ratio of integrated site specific extended haplotype homozygosity between populations (Rsb), and (iii) the composite likelihood ratio (CLR) method to discover selective sweeps in the Sheko genome. We identify 99 genomic regions harboring 364 signature genes in Sheko. Out of the signature genes, 15 genes are selected based on their biological importance described in the literature. We also identify 13 overrepresented pathways and 10 master regulators in Sheko using the TRANSPATH database in the geneXplain platform. Most of the pathways are related with oxidative stress responses indicating a possible selection response against the induction of oxidative stress following trypanosomiasis infection in Sheko. Furthermore, we present for the first time the importance of master regulators involved in trypanotolerance not only for the Sheko breed but also in the context of cattle genomics. Our finding shows that the master regulator Caspase is a key protease which plays a major role for the emergence of adaptive immunity in harmony with the other master regulators. These results suggest that designing and implementing genetic intervention strategies is necessary to improve the performance of susceptible animals. Moreover, the master regulatory analysis suggests potential candidate therapeutic targets for the development of new drugs for trypanosomiasis treatment."

        "abstract": "We analyzed the whole genomes of cecum microbiomes of Ethiopian indigenous chickens from two distinct geographical zones: Afar (AF) district (Dulecha, 730 m above sea level) and Amhara (AM) district (Menz Gera Midir, 3300 m). Through metagenomic analysis we found that microbial populations were mainly dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. We identified 2210 common genes in the two groups. LEfSe showed that the distribution of Coprobacter, Geobacter, Cronobacter, Alloprevotella, and Dysgonomonas were more abundant in AF than AM. Analyses using KEGG, eggNOG, and CAZy databases indicated that the pathways of metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and cellular process were significantly enriched. Functional abundance was found to be associated with the nutrient absorption and microbial localization of indigenous chickens. We also investigated antibiotic resistant genes and found antibiotics like LSM, cephalosporin, and tetracycline were significantly more abundant in AF than AM."

        "abstract": "Genomic selection (GS) has resulted in rapid rates of genetic gains especially in dairy cattle in developed countries resulting in a higher proportion of genomically proven young bulls being used in breeding. This success has been undergirded by well-established conventional genetic evaluation systems. Here, the status of GS in terms of the structure of the reference and validation populations, response variables, genomic prediction models, validation methods and imputation efficiency in breeding programs of developing countries, where smallholder systems predominate and the basic components for conventional breeding are mostly lacking is examined. Also, the application of genomic tools and identification of genome-wide signatures of selection is reviewed. The studies on genomic prediction in developing countries are mostly in dairy and beef cattle usually with small reference populations (500 to 3000 animals) and are mostly cows. The input variables tended to be pre-corrected phenotypic records and the small reference populations has made implementation of various Bayesian methods feasible in addition to GBLUP. Multi-trait single-step has been used to incorporate genomic information from foreign bulls, thus GS in developing countries would benefit from collaborations with developed countries, as many dairy sires used are from developed countries where they may have been genotyped and phenotyped. Cross validation approaches have been implemented in most studies resulting in accuracies of 0.20 to 0.60. Genotyping animals with a mixture of HD and LD chips, followed by imputation to the HD have been implemented with imputation accuracies of 0.74 to 0.99 reported. This increases the prospects of reducing genotyping costs and hence the cost-effectiveness of GS. Next-generation sequencing and associated technologies have allowed the determination of breed composition, parent verification, genome diversity and genome-wide selection sweeps. This information can be incorporated into breeding programs aiming to utilize GS. Cost-effective GS in beef cattle in developing countries may involve usage of reproductive technologies (AI and in-vitro fertilization) to efficiently propagate superior genetics from the genomics pipeline. For dairy cattle, sexed semen of genomically proven young bulls could substantially improve profitability thus increase prospects of small holder farmers buying-in into genomic breeding programs."

        "abstract": "African livestock breeds are numerous and diverse, and typically well adapted to the harsh environment conditions under which they perform. They have been used over centuries to provide livelihoods as well as food and nutritional security. However, African livestock systems are dynamic, with many small- and medium-scale systems transforming, to varying degrees, to become more profitable. In these systems the women and men livestock keepers are often seeking new livestock breeds or genotypes - typically those that increase household income through having enhanced productivity in comparison to traditional breeds while maintaining adaptedness. In recent years genomic approaches have started to be utilized in the identification and development of such breeds, and in this article we describe a number of examples to this end from sub-Saharan Africa. These comprise case studies on: (a) dairy cattle in Kenya and Senegal, as well as sheep in Ethiopia, where genomic approaches aided the identification of the most appropriate breed-type for the local productions systems; (b) a cross-breeding program for dairy cattle in East Africa incorporating genomic selection as well as other applications of genomics; (c) ongoing work toward creating a new cattle breed for East Africa that is both productive and resistant to trypanosomiasis; and (d) the use of African cattle as resource populations to identify genomic variants of economic or ecological significance, including a specific case where the discovery data was from a community based breeding program for small ruminants in Ethiopia. Lessons learnt from the various case studies are highlighted, and the concluding section of the paper gives recommendations for African livestock systems to increasingly capitalize on genomic technologies."

Respondents comprised experts and practitioners in livestock production and genetic resources from research institutes, animal breeding companies, universities, non-governmental organisations and government agricultural ministries. The main dairy farming system in which the respondents were involved was mixed crop-livestock system (30.2%), and this was mainly practised in the private land tenure system (46.3%). Data were analysed using linear model and paired Student t test in R software package. Respondents identified key issues affecting dairy production as poor genetic assessment of imported exotic breeds and crosses in Africa (62.3%), fluctuations in milk prices within both the formal and informal markets (50.9%), no comprehensive sire ranking systems (39.6%), housing and health management regimes which adversely affect milk yield (32.1%), poor market networks for dairy products (25.5%), poor feeding (13.3%), inadequate genetic technologies (9.4%) and poor animal performance recording systems (9.4%). Respondents emphasised the need for updated breeding policies, sire ranking systems, adequate farm management systems, capacity building, across-country collaborations and joint genetic assessments of dairy breeds found in sub-Saharan Africa. The current situation of dairy production though similar for the different countries, differed in order of emphasis and magnitude across the countries and regions in sub-Saharan Africa."

        "abstract": "Efforts to improve dairy production in smallholder farming systems of East Africa over the past decade have had limited impact because of the lack of records on performance to guide targeted breeding programs. Estimates of genetic parameters in these systems are lacking. Using data generated through a project (\u201cGermplasm for Dairy Development in East Africa\u201d) in Kenya and a genomic relationship matrix from genotypic records, we examined the potential impact of different models handling contemporary groups or herd effects on estimates of genetic parameters using a fixed regression model (FRM) for test-day (TD) milk yields, and the covariance structure for TD milk yield at various stages of lactation for animals using a random regression model (RRM). Models in which herd groups were defined using production levels derived from the data fitted the data better than those in which herds were grouped depending on management practices or were random. Lactation curves obtained for animals under different production categories did not display the typical peak yield characteristic of improved dairy systems in developed countries. Heritability estimates for TD milk yields using the FRM varied greatly with the definition of contemporary herd groups, ranging from 0.05 \u00b1 0.03 to 0.27 \u00b1 0.05 (mean \u00b1 standard error). The analysis using the RRM fitted the data better than the FRM. The heritability estimates for specific TD yields obtained by the RRM were higher than those obtained by the FRM. Genetic correlations between TD yields were high and positive for measures within short consecutive intervals but decreased as the intervals between TD increased beyond 60 d and became negative with intervals of more than 5 mo. The magnitude of the genetic correlation estimates among TD records indicates that using TD milk records beyond a 60-d interval as repeated measures of the same trait for genetic evaluation of animals on smallholder farms would not be optimal. Although each individual smallholder farmer retains only a few animals, using the genomic relationship between animals to link the large number of farmers operating under specified environments provides a sufficiently large herd-group for which a breeding program could be developed."

        "abstract": "Theileria parva is a protozoan parasite that causes East Coast fever (ECF), an economically important disease of cattle in Africa. It is transmitted mainly by the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Research efforts to develop a subunit vaccine based on parasite neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes have met with limited success. The molecular mechanisms underlying T. parva life cycle stages in the tick vector and bovine host are poorly understood, thus limiting progress toward an effective and efficient control of ECF. Transcriptomics has been used to identify candidate vaccine antigens or markers associated with virulence and disease pathology. Therefore, understanding how genes are expressed and where their products act in the pathogenic and infective forms of T. parva should shed more light on host-pathogen interactions in ECF and identify genes underlying difference in parasite stages as well as novel therapeutic targets. Recently, the first gene expression profiling of T. parva was conducted for the sporoblast, sporozoite and schizont stages. Sporozoite is infective to cattle whereas schizont is the major pathogenic form of the parasite. The schizont can differentiate into piroplasm which is infective to the tick vector. The present study was designed to extend the T. parva gene expression profiling to the piroplasm stage with reference to the schizont. Pairwise comparison revealed that 2,740 of a possible 4,084 protein coding genes were differentially expressed, with 1,407 (51%) genes up-regulated and 1,333 (49%) downregulated in the schizont relative to the piroplasm. In addition, over 160 genes were stage-specifically expressed. In general, there were more molecular functions, biological processes, subcellular localizations and pathways significantly enriched in the piroplasm than in the schizont. Using known antigens as benchmarks, we identified several new potential vaccine antigens, including TP04_0076 and TP04_0640, which were highly immunogenic in naturally T. parva-infected cattle. All the candidate vaccine antigens identified are yet to be investigated for their capacity to induce protective immune response against ECF."

        "abstract": "African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma) are vector-borne haemoparasites that survive in the vertebrate bloodstream through antigenic variation of their Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). Recombination, or rather segmented gene conversion, is fundamental in Trypanosoma brucei for both VSG gene switching and for generating antigenic diversity during infections. Trypanosoma vivax is a related, livestock pathogen whose VSG lack structures that facilitate gene conversion in T. brucei and mechanisms underlying its antigenic diversity are poorly understood. Here we show that species-wide VSG repertoire is broadly conserved across diverse T. vivax clinical strains and has limited antigenic repertoire. We use variant antigen profiling, coalescent approaches and experimental infections to show that recombination plays little role in diversifying T. vivax VSG sequences. These results have immediate consequences for both the current mechanistic model of antigenic variation in African trypanosomes and species differences in virulence and transmission, requiring reconsideration of the wider epidemiology of animal African trypanosomiasis. Trypanosoma rely on variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) to escape host immunity, but mechanisms generating antigenic diversity of VSG are poorly understood. Here, Silva-Pereira et al. show that T. vivax has a limited antigenic repertoire compared to T. brucei and that recombination plays little role in diversifying T. vivax VSG sequences."

        "abstract": "Background:Feed additives are a group of nutrient and non-nutrient compounds which helps farmers in improving the efficiency of feed utilization and thus reducing the high cost of feed. The current study aimed to determine some reproductive performances of local Kabir rooster fed with diets supplemented with thyme (Thymus vulgaris, Lamiaceae) powder. Materials and Methods: A total of 40kabir chicks were divided into four groups on the basis of the diet. One group (T0) received a basal diet (control),two others received a basal diet supplemented with 0.5% (T5) and 1% (T10) of thyme powder while the fourth (TOxy) received a commercial antibiotic, Oxykel 80 WP (0.5g\/L H2O). From the 24th week old, six roosters of each group were bred with females and eggs were collected and incubated to evaluate fertility and hatchability. At 28th week, the chickens were weighed; their comb and wattle size measured and they were slaughtered thereafter. Blood was collected for hormonal assessment. Collected sperm was characterized and testes were weighted, their size and volume evaluated. Results: Comb height and comb length as well as wattle length were not affected by the thyme supplementation of the diet. However, roosters fed on thyme, especially at 1% significantly increase (P\u02c20.05) the serum level of LH (5.51\u00b10.39 mUI\/mL) and testosterone (1.21\u00b10.27 mUI\/mL). These treatments increased sperm volume and the sperm mass motility (76.67\u00b18.16 %), sperm density (3.93\u00b10.12 %) the percentage of live sperm (94.33\u00b10.52 %) compared to the control diet. the spermatozoa abnormality rate was significantly high in TOxy group (3.75\u00b10.76%) and lowest in T10 (1.08\u00b10.49%). The same observation was recorded with the type of abnormality. Addition of 1% thyme in bird diet increased testes relative weight and volume. Thyme positively affected testes length, width and right testicular shape index. This supplement also significantly increased the fertility rate. Eggs fertilized by semen fromroosters fed diet containing 0.5 and 1% of Thyme showed the highest fertility rate. Conclusion:It could be concluded from this study that Thymus vulgaris could be used in poultry as additive diet to improve reproductive hormone level, semen quality, testes characteristics, fertility and eggs hatchability."

        "abstract": "Indigenous domestic chicken represents a major source of protein for agricultural communities around the world. In the Middle East and Africa, they are adapted to hot dry and semi-dry areas, in contrast to their wild ancestor, the Red junglefowl, which lives in humid and sub-humid tropical areas. Indigenous populations are declining following increased demand for poultry meat and eggs, favouring the more productive exotic commercial breeds. In this paper, using the D-loop of mitochondrial DNA as a maternally inherited genetic marker, we address the question of the origin and dispersal routes of domestic chicken of the Middle East (Iraq and Saudi Arabia), the northern part of the African continent (Algeria and Libya) and the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia). The analysis of the mtDNA D-loop of 706 chicken samples from Iraq (n\u2009=\u2009107), Saudi Arabia (n\u2009=\u2009185), Algeria (n\u2009=\u200988), Libya (n\u2009=\u200923), Ethiopia (n\u2009=\u2009211) and Pakistan (n\u2009=\u200992) show the presence of five haplogroups (A, B, C, D and E), suggesting more than one maternal origin for the studied populations. Haplogroup E, which occurred in 625 samples, was the most frequent in all countries. This haplogroup most likely originates from the Indian subcontinent and probably migrated following a terrestrial route to these different countries. Haplotypes belonging to haplogroup D were present in all countries except Algeria and Libya, it is likely a legacy of the Indian Ocean maritime trading network. Haplogroup A was present in all countries and may be of commercial origin. Haplogroup B was found only in Ethiopia. Haplogroup C was only detected in the South-Western region of Saudi Arabia and in Ethiopia. The results support a major influence of the Indian subcontinent on the maternal diversity of the today\u2019s chicken populations examined here. Most of the diversity occurs within rather than between populations. This lack of phylogeographic signal agrees with both ancient and more recent trading networks having shaped the modern-day diversity of indigenous chicken across populations and countries."

Use of ICT as an agricultural extension tool by smallholder farmers has the potential to reverse the scenario and improve farmers\u00f2utputs and incomes leading to increased welfare. This study employed the Propensity score Matching approach to evaluate the impacts of ICT-based extension services, in this case ICow services on milk production, milk income and household income using cross-sectional data from a survey of dairy farmers in Uasin Gishu, Nyandarua and Bomet counties of Kenya. Use of ICT-based iCow services is shown to increase milk production, milk income and household income by 25%, 29% and 22% respectively. Partnerships between network providers and research institutes should be encouraged as part of bridging the extension gap occasioned by reduced public expenditure on extension services."

        "abstract": "Hybridisation and introgression play key roles in the evolutionary history of animal species. They are commonly observed within several orders in wild birds.\u00a0The domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticus is the most common livestock species. More than 65 billion chickens are raised annually to produce meat and 80 million metric tons of egg for global human consumption by the commercial sector. Unravelling the origin of its genetic diversity has major application for sustainable breeding improvement programmes. In this study, we report genome-wide analyses for signatures of introgression between indigenous domestic village chicken and the four wild Gallus species. We first assess the genome-wide phylogeny and divergence time across the genus Gallus. Genome-wide sequence divergence analysis supports a sister relationship between the Grey junglefowl G. sonneratii and Ceylon junglefowl G. lafayettii. Both species form a clade that is sister to the Red junglefowl G. gallus, with the Green junglefowl G. varius the most ancient lineage within the genus. We reveal extensive bidirectional introgression between the Grey junglefowl and the domestic chicken and to a much lesser extent with the Ceylon junglefowl. We identify a single case of Green junglefowl introgression. These introgressed regions include genes with\u00a0biological functions related to development and immune system. Our study shows that while the Red junglefowl is the main ancestral species, introgressive hybridisation episodes have impacted the genome and contributed to the diversity of the domestic chicken, although likely at different levels across its geographic range."

        "abstract": "Pigs are sensitive to heat stress as they lack functioning sweat glands and have small lungs, which reduce their ability to disseminate heat by panting. Moreover, there is limited attention to impacts of climate change on pigs in Uganda by stakeholders despite the potential vulnerability of pigs to heat stress. The objectives of the study were to i) determine the heat-stress status in pigs, ii) analyse factors influencing heat-stress, and iii) explore the heat-stress adaptation options in Lira District, Uganda. Data on heat-stress indicators was collected from a survey of 104 households and measuring 259 pigs in Ojwina (Urban) and Barr (Rural) sub-counties of Lira district. Heat-stress indicators included skin temperature (ST=36.32 \u2022 C\u00b12 \u2022 C), and rectal temperature (RT=39.06 \u2022 C\u00b10.83 \u2022 C). Ordinary Least Squares linear regression analysis assessed the factors influencing each of the heat-stress indicators. Adaptation options were explored during four gender dis-aggregated focus group discussions with 15 male and 16 female participants in total. The preferred adaptation options were analysed using the average preference rating. According to the farmers, 51.6 % of the pigs were heat-stressed. The results showed that heat stress was influenced by the external temperature humidity index, pig management system, pig category, colour, heart girth, water quantity given, pig's body condition score and time of the day. The results showed that the most preferred adaptation options included constructing a high pig pen roof to facilitate easy air flow (Average Preference Rating = APR = 4.75); pouring water on the pigs (APR = 4.63); and allowing pigs to swim\/wallow (APR=4.48). These heat stress adaptation options are suited to the local farm conditions in Lira and offer insight into appropriate techniques that could be applied elsewhere to improve livelihoods and food security. This study confirmed the importance of heat stress risk to pig production in Uganda, and more attention from stakeholders and policy makers is needed."

        "abstract": "Background Genetic evaluation is a central component of a breeding program. In advanced economies, most genetic evaluations depend on large quantities of data that are recorded on commercial farms. Large herd sizes and widespread use of artificial insemination create strong genetic connectedness that enables the genetic and environmental effects of an individual animal\u2019s phenotype to be accurately separated. In contrast to this, herds are neither large nor have strong genetic connectedness in smallholder dairy production systems of many low to middle-income countries (LMIC). This limits genetic evaluation, and furthermore, the pedigree information needed for traditional genetic evaluation is typically unavailable. Genomic information keeps track of shared haplotypes rather than shared relatives. This information could capture and strengthen genetic connectedness between herds and through this may enable genetic evaluations for LMIC smallholder dairy farms. The objective of this study was to use simulation to quantify the power of genomic information to enable genetic evaluation under such conditions.\r\n\r\nResults The results from this study show: (i) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows using genomic information had higher accuracy compared to pedigree information across all breeding designs; (ii) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows with genomic information and modelling herd as a random effect had higher or equal accuracy compared to modelling herd as a fixed effect; (iii) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows from breeding designs with strong genetic connectedness had higher accuracy compared to breeding designs with weaker genetic connectedness; (iv) genomic prediction of young bulls was possible using marker estimates from the genetic evaluations of their phenotyped dams. For example, the accuracy of genomic prediction of young bulls from an average herd size of 1 (\u03bc=1.58) was 0.40 under a breeding design with 1,000 sires mated per generation and a training set of 8,000 phenotyped and genotyped cows.\r\n\r\nConclusions This study demonstrates the potential of genomic information to be an enabling technology in LMIC smallholder dairy production systems by facilitating genetic evaluations with in-situ records collected from farms with herd sizes of four cows or less. Across a range of breeding designs, genomic data enabled accurate genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows and genomic prediction of young bulls using data sets that contained small herds with weak genetic connections. The use of smallholder dairy data in genetic evaluations would enable the establishment of breeding programs to improve in-situ germplasm and, if required, would enable the importation of the most suitable external germplasm. This could be individually tailored for each target environment. Together this would increase the productivity, profitability and sustainability of LMIC smallholder dairy production systems. However, data collection, including genomic data, is expensive and business models will need to be carefully constructed so that the costs are sustainably offset."

        "abstract": "Background: The Infection and Treatment Method (ITM) of vaccination is the only immunization procedure currently available to protect cattle against East Coast fever (ECF), a tick-transmitted disease responsible for losses of several hundreds of millions of dollars per year in sub-Saharan Africa. The vaccine comprises a homogenized preparation of infected ticks packaged in straws and stored in liquid nitrogen. The current manufacturing protocol results in straws containing 30-40 doses (ILRI 0804), which is impractical for immunizing small herds as found in dairy and smallholder farming systems. The ILRI 0804 SD stabilate was prepared as a 1:5 dilution of the parent stabilate, with the aim of producing vaccine stabilate straws containing between four to eight doses and thus suitable for smallholder farming systems. Infectivity of the diluted stabilate was assessed and the protective efficacy of the diluted stabilate was determined by performing experimental and field immunizations. Results: Two groups of six cattle were inoculated with 1 ml of the diluted stabilate at 1:20 (equivalent to the recommended field dose for ILRI 0804, assuming no loss of sporozoite viability during thawing and refreezing) and 1:14 (assuming 30-35% loss of sporozoite viability). Schizonts were detected in all 12 animals, showing viability of sporozoites. Ten animals from the infectivity study and two control animals not previously exposed to T. parva were challenged with the parental ILRI 0804 stabilate. The results show that the two control animals displayed severe ECF reactions and were treated 14 days after challenge. Of the previously infected animals, only one underwent a severe reaction following challenge, a result in accord with the challenge experiments performed previously with the parent stabilate [Ticks Tick-Borne Dis 7:306-314, 2016]. The animal that displayed a severe reaction had no detectable schizonts and did not seroconvert following the initial inoculation with ILRI 0804 SD. In addition, 62 animals immunized under field conditions showed a mean seroconversion rate of 82%. Conclusion: The results presented in this article demonstrate that it is possible to prepare straws suitable for use in smallholder herds by thawing, diluting and refreezing already packaged vaccine."

        "abstract": "Livestock production systems of the developing world use indigenous breeds that locally adapted to specific agro-ecologies. Introducing commercial breeds usually results in lower productivity than expected, as a result of unfavourable genotype by environment interaction. It is difficult to predict of how these commercial breeds will perform in different conditions encountered in e.g. sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we present a novel methodology to model performance, by using growth data from different chicken breeds that were tested in Ethiopia. The suitability of these commercial breeds was tested by predicting the response of body weight as a function of the environment across ethiopia. phenotype distribution models were built using machine learning algorithms to make predictions of weight in the local environmental conditions based on the productivity for the breed. Based on the predicted body weight, breeds were assigned as being most suitable in a given agro-ecology or region. We identified the most important environmental variables that explained the variation in body weight across agro-ecologies for each of the breeds. our results highlight the importance of acknowledging the role of environment in predicting productivity in scavenging chicken production systems. the use of phenotype distribution models in livestock breeding is recommended to develop breeds that will better fit in their intended production environment."

        "abstract": "Predicting breed-specific environmental suitability has been problematic in livestock production. Native breeds have low productivity but are thought to be more robust to perform under local conditions than exotic breeds. Attempts to introduce genetically improved exotic breeds are generally unsuccessful, mainly due to the antagonistic environmental conditions. Knowledge of the environmental conditions that are shaping the breed would be needed to determine its suitability to different locations. Here, we present a methodology to predict the suitability of breeds for different agro-ecological zones using Geographic Information Systems tools and predictive habitat distribution models. This methodology was tested on the current distribution of two introduced chicken breeds in Ethiopia: the Koekoek, originally from South Africa, and the Fayoumi, originally from Egypt. Cross-validation results show this methodology to be effective in predicting breed suitability for specific environmental conditions. Furthermore, the model predicts suitable areas of the country where the breeds could be introduced. The specific climatic parameters that explained the potential distribution of each of the breeds were similar to the environment from which the breeds originated. This novel methodology finds application in livestock programs, allowing for a more informed decision when designing breeding programs and introduction programs, and increases our understanding of the role of the environment in livestock productivity."

        "abstract": "Like most West African Bos taurus, the shorthorn Muturu is under threat of replacement or crossbreeding with zebu. Their populations are now reduced to a few hundred breeding individuals and they are considered endangered. So far, the genetic variation and genetic basis of the trypanotolerant Muturu environmental adaptation have not been assessed. Here, we present genome-wide candidate positive selection signatures in Muturu following within-population iHS and between population Rsb signatures of selection analysis. We compared the results in Muturu with the ones obtained in N'Dama, a West African longhorn trypanotolerant taurine, and in two European taurine (Holstein and Jersey). The results reveal candidate signatures of selection regions in Muturu including genes linked to the innate (e.g., TRIM10, TRIM15, TRIM40, and TRIM26) and the adaptive (e.g., JSP.1, BOLA-DQA2, BOLA-DQA5, BOLA-DRB3, and BLA-DQB) immune responses. The most significant regions are identified on BTA 23 at the bovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (iHS analysis) and on BTA 12 at genes including a heat tolerance gene (INTS6) (Rsb analysis). Other candidate selected regions include genes related to growth traits\/stature (e.g., GHR and GHRHR), coat color (e.g., MITF and KIT), feed efficiency (e.g., ZRANB3 and MAP3K5) and reproduction (e.g., RFX2, SRY, LAP3, and GPX5). Genes under common signatures of selection regions with N'Dama, including for adaptive immunity and heat tolerance, suggest shared mechanisms of adaptation to environmental challenges for these two West African taurine cattle. Interestingly, out of the 242,910 SNPs identified within the candidate selected regions in Muturu, 917 are missense SNPs (0.4%), with an unequal distribution across 273 genes. Fifteen genes including RBBP8, NID1, TEX15, LAMA3, TRIM40, and OR12D3 comprise 220 missense variants, each between 11 and 32. Our results, while providing insights into the candidate genes under selection in Muturu, are paving the way to the identification of genes and their polymorphisms linked to the unique tropical adaptive traits of the West Africa taurine, including trypanotolerance."

        "abstract": "This study was carried out to assess the genetic diversities and population structure of six camel populations of Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected from 114 camels (17-24 per population) and genotyped using10 camel microsatellite marker loci. The result revealed high genetic diversities in Ethiopian camel populations with average observed and expected heterozygosity, total number of alleles (TNA), mean number of alleles (MNA) and effective number of alleles of 0.55, 0.73,153, 6.8 (0.36) and 4.47(0.23), respectively. Among the 52 private alleles in the six Ethiopian camel populations, 31 of them were occurring at a frequency of \u22655%. It was also found that most of the variations in Ethiopian camels were attributed to within population variation (92%) while 8% was explained by between populations variation. Even though there was high heterozygosity, high inbreeding coefficient was detected in Ethiopian camel populations. From the sex camel populations 34.1, 33.4 and 28.6% alleles of Gelleb, Amibara and Liben camel populations respectively affected by inbreeding. The between population differentiation was (F ST =0.11(\uf0b10.01) indicating moderate population differentiation. The neighbor-joining tree and structure analysis show that the Ethiopian camel populations were clustered into four subgroups. The Afar camels were grouped into two together with the Ethiopian Somali camels (Jigjiga with Mille and Gelleb with Amibara) and the two Ogaden camels (Liben and Hoor) are separated into two subgroups indicating that some of the Afar and the Somali camels were admixed. Therefore, even though high hetrozygosity within population and moderate genetic differentiation between populations were observed, the presence of high inbreeding coefficient may affect hetrozygosity in the overall populations."

        "abstract": "The Near East cattle are adapted to different agro-ecological zones including desert areas, mountains habitats, and humid regions along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers system. The region was one of the earliest and most significant areas of cattle husbandry. Currently, four main breeds of Iraqi cattle are recognized. Among these, the Jenoubi is found in the southern more humid part of Iraq, while the Rustaqi is found in the middle and drier region of the country. Despite their importance, Iraqi cattle have up to now been poorly characterized at the genome level. Here, we report at a genome-wide level the diversity and signature of positive selection in these two breeds. Thirty-five unrelated Jenoubi cattle, sampled in the Maysan and Basra regions, and 60 Rustaqi cattle, from around Baghdad and Babylon, were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip (700K). Genetic population structure and diversity level were studied using principal component analysis (PCA), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho), and admixture. Signatures of selection were studied using extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) (iHS and Rsb) and inter-population Wright's Fst. The results of PCA and admixture analysis, including European taurine, Asian indicine, African indicine, and taurine indicate that the two breeds are crossbreed zebu \u00d7 taurine, with more zebu background in Jenoubi cattle compared with Rustaqi. The Rustaqi has the greatest mean heterozygosity (He = 0.37) among all breeds. iHS and Rsb signatures of selection analyses identify 68 candidate genes under positive selection in the two Iraqi breeds, while Fst analysis identifies 220 candidate genes including genes related to the innate and acquired immunity responses, different environmental selection pressures (e.g., tick resistance and heat stress), and genes of commercial interest (e.g., marbling score)."

        "abstract": "Hybridization and\/or introgression play a key role in the evolutionary history of animal species. It is commonly observed in several orders in wild birds. The domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticus is the commonest livestock species exploited for the benefit of mankind. The origin of its diversity remains unsettled. Here, we report a genome-wide analyses for signatures of introgression within domestic village chicken. We first established the genome-wide phylogeny and divergence time across the genus Gallus , showing the sister relationships between Grey junglefowl G. sonneratii and Ceylon junglefowl G. lafayettii and that the Green junglefowl is the first diverging lineage within the genus Gallus . Then, by analysing the whole-genome sequences of geographically diverse chicken populations, we reveal extensive bidirectional introgression between Grey junglefowl and domestic chicken and to a much less extent with Ceylon junglefowl. A single case of Green junglefowl G. varius introgression was identified. These introgressed regions include biological functions related to the control of gene expression. Our results show that while the Red junglefowl is the main ancestral species, introgressive hybridization episodes have impacted the genome and contributed to the diversity of domestic chicken, although likely at different level across its geographic range."

        "abstract": "Cost-effective high-density (HD) genotypes of livestock species can be obtained by genotyping a proportion of the population using a HD panel and the remainder using a cheaper low-density panel, and then imputing the missing genotypes that are not directly assayed in the low-density panel. The efficacy of genotype imputation can largely be affected by the structure and history of the specific target population and it should be checked before incorporating imputation in routine genotyping practices. Here, we investigated the efficacy of imputation in crossbred dairy cattle populations of East Africa using 4 different commercial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panels, 3 reference populations, and 3 imputation algorithms. We found that Minimac and a reference population, which included a mixture of crossbred and ancestral purebred animals, provided the highest imputation accuracy compared with other scenarios of imputation. The accuracies of imputation, measured as the correlation between real and imputed genotypes averaged across SNP, were around 0.76 and 0.94 for 7K and 40K SNP, respectively, when imputed up to a 770K panel. We also presented a method to maximize the imputation accuracy of low-density panels, which relies on the pairwise (co)variances between SNP and the minor allele frequency of SNP. The performance of the developed method was tested in a 5-fold cross-validation process where various densities of SNP were selected using the (co)variance method and also by alternative SNP selection methods and then imputed up to the HD panel. The (co)variance method provided the highest imputation accuracies at almost all marker densities, with accuracies being up to 0.19 higher than the random selection of SNP. The accuracies of imputation from 7K and 40K panels selected using the (co)variance method were around 0.80 and 0.94, respectively. The presented method also achieved higher accuracy of genomic prediction at lower densities of selected SNP. The squared correlation between genomic breeding values estimated using imputed genotypes and those from the real 770K HD panel was 0.95 when the accuracy of imputation was 0.64. The presented method for SNP selection is straightforward in its application and can ensure high accuracies in genotype imputation of crossbred dairy populations in East Africa."

        "abstract": "In this study, to identify genomic signatures of divergent selection, we genotyped 10 cattle breeds\/populations (n = 275), representing eight Ethiopian cattle populations (n = 229) and two zebu populations (n = 46) adapted to tropical and sub-tropical environments, using the high-density single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived mainly from Bos indicus breeds, and using five reference taurine breeds (n = 212). Population genetic differentiation (FST) values across sliding windows were estimated between zebu and reference combined taurine breeds. The most differentiated regions (FST \u2265 0.53), representing the top 1% smoothed FST values, were considered to represent regions under diversifying selection. In total, 285 and 317 genes were identified in the comparisons of Ethiopian cattle with taurine and Asian zebu with taurine respectively. Some of these genes are involved in stress responses\/thermo-tolerance and DNA damage repair (HSPA4, HSF1, CMPK1 and EIF2AK4), pigmentation (ERBB3 and MYO1A), reproduction\/fertility (UBE2D3, ID3 and PSPC1), immune response (PIK3CD and AKIRIN2) and body stature and size (MBP2, LYN and NPM1). Additionally, the candidate genes were associated with functional terms (e.g. cellular response to stress, DNA repair, inflammatory response) important for physiological adaptation to environmental stresses. The results of our study may shed light on the influence of artificial and natural selection in shaping the genomic diversity of modern cattle breeds and also may serve as a basis for further genetic investigation of traits of tropical adaptation in cattle."

        "abstract": "Village chickens are ubiquitous in smallholder farming systems, contributing to household, local and national economies under diverse environmental, economic and cultural settings. However, they are raised in challenging environments where productivity is low while mortality is high. There is much interest in utilizing indigenous genetic resources to produce a chicken that is resilient to its environment, while at the same time providing the basis of an economically sustainable enterprise. Globally, however, a wide variety of interventions have so far proved unable to deliver sustainable improvements. Here we show that regional differences in trait preferences and parasite burden are associated with distinct chicken gene pools, probably in response to interactions between natural and human-driven (economic and social) selection pressures. Drivers of regional differences include marketing opportunities, cultural preferences, agro-ecologies and parasite populations, and are evident in system adaptations, such as management practices, population dynamics and bird genotypes. Our results provide sound multidisciplinary evidence to support previous observations that sustainable poultry development interventions for smallholder farmers, including breeding programmes, should be locally tailored and designed for flexible implementation."

        "abstract": "Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country; the low altitude regions are hot and humid whereas the high altitude regions are cooler. In this study we analyzed the transcriptome response of high altitude (Addis Ababa) and low altitude (Awash) chickens to heat stress conditions that are prevalent in the low altitude regions. The chickens were free ranged for 20 h in an enclosure in Awash, and then the heart, breast muscle and spleen tissues were collected at 6:00 am, 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm to follow a daily circadian cycle. Through RNA\u2010sequencing analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significant (q < 0.05). These DEGs were subjected to protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network and gene co\u2010expression network (GCN) analyses to understand their role. KEGG pathway analysis and Gene Ontology analysis of all the identified DEGs and the genes identified from the PPI network and GCN analyses revealed that several immune\u2010related pathways, such as proteasome, focal adhesion, influenza A, the ErbB signaling pathway and glycerophospholipid metabolism, were enriched in response to heat stress. These results suggest that the high altitude chickens were under heat stress and might be immunologically susceptible. Our findings will help in developing a genetic approach to mitigate production loss due to heat stress."

        "abstract": "Indigenous cattle make a significant contribution to the livelihood of many communities in Ethiopia, Tanzania and other countries in eastern Africa. Here, we identify the genetic structure and the admixture levels of several East African indigenous cattle breeds in Ethiopia and Tanzania. Two 'groups' were studied: Indigenous cattle consisting of a number of breeds; and Mpwapwa cattle-a composite breed. A total of 386 individual animals from the two groups were genotyped using the Illumina high-density Bovine SNP chip (778k Panel). Principal component analysis was used to study the genetic structure and admixture levels of the indigenous cattle, and Mpwapwa were estimated using the ADMIXTURE program. All East African indigenous breeds other than the Ankole appear genetically closely related to each other and consist of a mixture of African taurine and indicine signals. Ethiopian indigenous breeds, Fogera, Danakil Harar and Ethiopian Boran show high purity, whereas Ethiopian Central Highland Breed and the Begait samples show significant amounts of European Bos taurus admixture. Tanzanian indigenous cattle, Singida White and Iringa Red, have a high degree of purity while the TALIRI Boran shows some European Bos taurus genetic background. The synthetic Mpwapwa breed had estimated breed proportions of Bos indicus, African Bos taurus and European Bos taurus of 0.82, 0.05 and 0.13 respectively. These results are useful for genetic conservation and genetic improvement programs."

        "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 Springer Nature B.V. Livestock traders are a key conduit for incentives in livestock production systems. Their actions affect producer prices, investment decisions, and their livelihoods. However, smallholder farmers in rural communities of eastern Africa often have limited understanding of the marketing process and the interactions among market actors. This study was undertaken following the introduction of improved indigenous goat and sheep breeds in Climate Smart Villages of Nyando in western Kenya. We sought to understand the marketing of sheep and goats in five key rural markets used by the smallholder farmers of Nyando, to generate information on key market actors, their functions in the value chain, and their preferences for attributes in sheep and goats. Most traders (65%) in all the markets were men. Four different types of traders operated in the markets, producers, retailers, wholesalers, and brokers, each making a profit. Preference for selling sheep or goats and the animal attributes desired by the traders differed depending on the surrounding community. Markets in Kericho County of Nyando traded more goats than sheep while those in Kisumu County of Nyando traded more sheep than goats. There were no clear policies guiding pricing of animals. Prices offered to producers depended on previous days, and the number of animals available for sale at the marketing point. The collaborative group actions of the producers in the Climate Smart Villages did not extend beyond the level of production to the marketing of their livestock. A critical change is required for the smallholder farmers to derive better incomes from improved quality of animals following adoption of improved breeding and management practices. The results illustrate the need to engage rural market actors when implementing livestock improvement programs for smallholder farmers for better farm gate prices of animals, and thus achieve the improved incomes envisioned."

        "abstract": "Pseudo-phenotypes, such as 305-day yields, estimated breeding values or deregressed proofs, are usually used as response variables for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of milk production traits in dairy cattle. Computational inefficiency challenges the direct use of test-day records for longitudinal GWAS with large datasets. We propose a rapid longitudinal GWAS method that is based on a random regression model. Our method uses Eigen decomposition of the phenotypic covariance matrix to rotate the data, thereby transforming the complex mixed linear model into weighted least squares analysis. We performed a simulation study that showed that our method can control type I errors well and has higher power than a longitudinal GWAS method that does not include time-varied additive genetic effects. We also applied our method to the analysis of milk production traits in the first three parities of 6711 Chinese Holstein cows. The analysis for each trait was completed within 1 day with known variances. In total, we located 84 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of which 65 were within previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions. Our rapid method can control type I errors in the analysis of longitudinal data and can be applied to other longitudinal traits. We detected QTL that were for the most part similar to those reported in a previous study in Chinese Holstein. Moreover, six additional SNPs for fat percentage and 13 SNPs for protein percentage were identified by our method. These additional 19 SNPs could be new candidate quantitative trait nucleotides for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein."

        "abstract": "Mammary gland is an important organ for milk synthesis and secretion. It undergoes dramatic physiological changes to adapt the shift from peak to late lactation stage. Protein plays a final very vital role in many life functions, and the protein changes during different lactation stages potentially reflect the biology of lactation and the functions of mammary gland in cows. In current study, we adopted tandem mass tags label-based quantitative analysis technique and to investigate proteome changes occurring in bovine mammary gland from peak to late lactation stages. A total of 3753 proteins from mammary tissues taken at two lactation points from four individual cows by biopsy were quantified, out of which 179 proteins were expressed differentially between two stages. We observed five new DEPs (AACS, DHCR7, GSTM3, SFRP1 and SFRP4) and nine functional well-studies known proteins (PLIN2, LPIN1, PLIN3, GSN, CD74, MMP2, SOD1, SOD3 and GPX3) related to milk performance and mammary morphology. Bioinformatics analyses of the DEPs showed a majority of the up-regulated proteins during late lactation stage were related to apoptosis and immune process, while the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in localization, lipid metabolic and transport process. This suggests that the mammary gland can adapt to different molecular functions according to the biological need of the animal. From the integrated analysis of the differentially expressed proteins with known quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association study data, we identified 95 proteins may potentially affect milking performance. We expect findings in this study could be a valuable resource for future studies investigating the bovine proteome and functional studies."

        "abstract": "Artificial selection towards a desired phenotype\/trait has modified the genomes of livestock dramatically that generated breeds that greatly differ in morphology, production and environmental adaptation traits. Angus cattle are among the famous cattle breeds developed for superior beef quality. This paper aimed at exploring genomic regions under selection in Angus cattle that are associated with meat quality traits and other associated phenotypes. The whole genome of 10 Angus cattle was compared with 11 Hanwoo (A-H) and 9 Jersey (A-J) cattle breeds using a cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XP-CLR) statistical method. The top 1% of the empirical distribution was taken as significant and annotated using UMD3.1. As a result, 255 and 210 genes were revealed under selection from A\u2013H and A\u2013J comparisons, respectively. The WebGestalt gene ontology analysis resulted in sixteen (A\u2013H) and five (A\u2013J) significantly enriched KEGG pathways. Several pathways associated with meat quality traits (insulin signaling, type II diabetes mellitus pathway, focal adhesion pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction), and feeding efficiency (olfactory transduction, tight junction, and metabolic pathways) were enriched. Genes affecting beef quality traits (e.g., FABP3, FTO, DGAT2, ACS, ACAA2, CPE, TNNI1), stature and body size (e.g., PLAG1, LYN, CHCHD7, RPS20), fertility and dystocia (e.g., ESR1, RPS20, PPP2R1A, GHRL, PLAG1), feeding efficiency (e.g., PIK3CD, DNAJC28, DNAJC3, GHRL, PLAG1), coat color (e.g., MC1-R) and genetic disorders (e.g., ITGB6, PLAG1) were found to be under positive selection in Angus cattle. The study identified genes and pathways that are related to meat quality traits and other phenotypes of Angus cattle. The findings in this study, after validation using additional or independent dataset, will provide useful information for the study of Angus cattle in particular and beef cattle in general."

        "abstract": "In most smallholder dairy programmes, farmers are not fully benefitting from the genetic potential of their dairy cows. This is in part due to the mismatch between the available genotypes and the environment, including management, in which the animals perform. With sparse performance and pedigree records in smallholder dairy farms, the true degree of baseline genetic variability and breed composition is not known and hence rendering any genetic improvement initiative difficult to implement. Using the Girinka programme of Rwanda as an exemplar, the current study was aimed at better understanding the genetic diversity and population structure of dairy cattle in the smallholder dairy farm set up. Further, the association between farmer self-reported cow genotypes and genetically determined genotypes was investigated. The average heterozygosity estimates were highest (0.38 \u00b1 0.13) for Rwandan dairy cattle and lowest for Gir and N'Dama (0.18 \u00b1 0.19 and 0.25 \u00b1 0.20, respectively). Systematic characterization of the genetic variation and diversity available may inform the formulation of sustainable improvement strategies such as targeting and matching the genotype of cows to productivity goals and farmer profile and hence reducing the negative impact of genotype by environment interaction."

The data for the study were collected from conventional hill and low land farming systems. The data were from 48,277 lambs. Genetic parameters were estimated using uni- and bivariate animal models for weight at birth (BWT), live weight at 8 weeks (8WK), ultrasound scanning at 21 weeks of age (SWT) and weight at tupping (MW), ultrasound scanned muscle (MD) and fat (FD) depth measured at 21 weeks of age, litter size born (LSB), litter size reared (LSR), faecal egg count for strongyle (FEC<sub>S<\/sub>) and nematodes (FEC<sub>N<\/sub>). Maternal genetic effects were fitted for BWT, and 8WK. Direct heritability estimates were 0.14\u00b10.01 for BWT, 0.35\u00b10.02 for 8WK, 0.46\u00b10.01 for SWT, 0.31\u00b10.01 for MD, 0.38\u00b10.01 for FD, 0.38\u00b10.01 for MW, 0.22\u00b10.09 for FEC<sub>S<\/sub> and 0.16\u00b10.10 for FEC<sub>N<\/sub>. Maternal heritability estimates were 0.14\u00b10.01 for BWT and 0.11\u00b10.01 for 8WK. Direct genetic correlations among studied traits ranged from \u22120.05 (MW\u2013FD) to 0.90 (SWT\u20138WK). Phenotypic and environmental correlation estimates were generally lower than those of genetic correlation. Our results indicate that the genetic parameters generated in this study could be used in selection index calculations to asses the benefits of including lamb carcass traits in future selection programmes for Lleyn sheep. Also, this study provides valuable information in terms of genetic parameters for growth and carcass traits which can be used for genetic evaluation and in designing selection programmes for the Lleyn breed.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to estimate genomic breeding values for milk yield in crossbred dairy goats. The research was based on data provided by 2 commercial goat farms in the UK comprising 590,409 milk yield records on 14,453 dairy goats kidding between 1987 and 2013. The population was created by crossing 3 breeds: Alpine, Saanen, and Toggenburg. In each generation the best performing animals were selected for breeding, and as a result, a synthetic breed was created. The pedigree file contained 30,139 individuals, of which 2,799 were founders. The data set contained test-day records of milk yield, lactation number, farm, age at kidding, and year and season of kidding. Data on milk composition was unavailable. In total 1,960 animals were genotyped with the Illumina 50K caprine chip. Two methods for estimation of genomic breeding value were compared\u2014BLUP at the single nucleotide polymorphism level (BLUP-SNP) and single-step BLUP. The highest accuracy of 0.61 was obtained with single-step BLUP, and the lowest (0.36) with BLUP-SNP. Linkage disequilibrium (r2, the squared correlation of the alleles at 2 loci) at 50 kb (distance between 2 SNP) was 0.18. This is the first attempt to implement genomic selection in UK dairy goats. Results indicate that the single-step method provides the highest accuracy for populations with a small number of genotyped individuals, where the number of genotyped males is low and females are predominant in the reference population."

        "abstract": "Key messages \uf0b7 Rapid development of novel tools for phenotyping, genetic and genomic analyses, reproduction, and modelling offers opportunities to speed up the genetic gain of complex traits to meet the needs of animal breeding programs. \uf0b7 Successful application of novel tools depends on a complete understanding of the innovation circle of the particular technology and model, and its associated basic technical procedures and minimal management costs. \uf0b7 Implementing new phenotyping and genotyping tools requires adequate infrastructure and training of farmers and national agricultural research system (NARS) scientists to enable early participation for enhanced impact in low-income countries. Circle of innovation The design of a breeding program largely depends on adequate infrastructure\u2014ranging from efficient collection of phenotypes, development of models, data analysis, program implementation to buy-in from the public and farmers. This key infrastructure is usually lacking in developing countries. Using novel tools that circumvent these constraints offers many opportunities to developing countries. However, this requires a range of scientific expertise not readily available, underlining the importance of collaboration between advanced universities and research institutes. Based on advances in information technology, molecular biology, genetics and statistical methods, these tools are applicable to various aspects of breeding programs ranging from data collection and model design to program implementation. Putting these novel tools into use typically follows a circle of innovation (see Figure 1). When a new tool has been proposed, the first step is to test its performance in a pilot study or specific experiment. The next stage is to evaluate whether it can make a positive contribution to the breeding program followed by a 'go\/don't go' decision regarding its implementation. The pace of innovation depends on the type of tool, the required infrastructure to implement it, the target species, and ownership of different aspects of the breeding program.

        "abstract": "Genetic evaluations for resistance to bovine tuberculosis (bTB) were calculated based on British national data including individual animal tuberculin skin test results, postmortem examination (presence of bTB lesions and bacteriological culture for Mycobacterium bovis), animal movement and location information, production history, and pedigree records. Holstein cows with identified sires in herds with bTB breakdowns (new herd incidents) occurring between the years 2000 and 2014 were considered. In the first instance, cows with a positive reaction to the skin test and a positive postmortem examination were defined as infected. Values of 0 and 1 were assigned to healthy and infected animal records, respectively. Data were analyzed with mixed models. Linear and logit function heritability estimates were 0.092 and 0.172, respectively. In subsequent analyses, breakdowns were split into 2-mo intervals to better model time of exposure and infection in the contemporary group. Intervals with at least one infected individual were retained and multiple intervals within the same breakdown were included. Healthy animal records were assigned values of 0, and infected records a value of 1 in the interval of infection and values reflecting a diminishing probability of infection in the preceding intervals. Heritability and repeatability estimates were 0.115 and 0.699, respectively. Reliabilities and across time stability of the genetic evaluation were improved with the interval model. Subsequently, 2 more definitions of \"infected\" were analyzed with the interval model: (1) all positive skin test reactors regardless of postmortem examination, and (2) all positive skin test reactors plus nonreactors with positive postmortem examination. Estimated heritability was 0.085 and 0.089, respectively; corresponding repeatability estimates were 0.701 and 0.697. Genetic evaluation reliabilities and across time stability did not change. Correlations of genetic evaluations for bTB with other traits in the current breeding goal were mostly not different from zero. Correlation with the UK Profitable Lifetime Index was moderate, significant, and favorable. Results demonstrated the feasibility of a national genetic evaluation for bTB resistance. Selection for enhanced resistance will have a positive effect on profitability and no antagonistic effects on current breeding goal traits. Official genetic evaluations are now based on the interval model and the last bTB trait definition."

This allows carcases to be better differentiated and farmers to be paid based on the primal cut yields. It also creates more accurate genetic selection due to high volumes of data which enables breeders to breed cattle that better meet the abattoir specifications and market requirements. In order to implement genetic evaluations for VIA primal cut yields, genetic parameters must first be estimated and that was the aim of this study. Slaughter records from the UK prime slaughter population for VIA carcass traits was available from two processing plants. After edits, there were 17 765 VIA carcass records for six primal cut traits, carcass weight as well as the EUROP conformation and fat class grades. Heritability estimates after traits were adjusted for age ranged from 0.32 (0.03) for EUROP fat to 0.46 (0.03) for VIA Topside primal cut yield. Adjusting the VIA primal cut yields for carcass weight reduced the heritability estimates, with estimates of primal cut yields ranging from 0.23 (0.03) for Fillet to 0.29 (0.03) for Knuckle. Genetic correlations between VIA primal cut yields adjusted for carcass weight were very strong, ranging from 0.40 (0.06) between Fillet and Striploin to 0.92 (0.02) between Topside and Silverside. EUROP conformation was also positively correlated with the VIA primal cuts with genetic correlation estimates ranging from 0.59 to 0.84, whereas EUROP fat was estimated to have moderate negative correlations with primal cut yields, estimates ranged from \u22120.11 to \u22120.46. Based on these genetic parameter estimates, genetic evaluation of VIA primal cut yields can be undertaken to allow the UK beef industry to select carcases that better meet abattoir specification and market requirements.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Until recently, the main selection focus in UK dairy goats has been on milk yield. To develop a selection index suitably weighted for a variety of traits, it is important to understand the genetic relationships between production, health and fertility traits. This study focussed on three aspects of reproduction that are of interest to goat breeders. (1) Out of season (OOS) kidding ability: goats are highly seasonal breeders so achieving consistent, year-round dairy production presents a challenge. It may be possible to select for extended or shifted breeding cycles, however, there are no published studies on the genetic basis of seasonal kidding ability, and a genetic correlation with milk production in dairy goats; (2) age at first kidding (AFK): a reduced AFK offers the opportunity for more rapid genetic improvement, as well as reducing the amount of time and resources required to raise the animals to producing age; (3) pseudopregnancy (PPG): as it is difficult to diagnose pregnancy within 30 days of mating, high herd levels of PPG could add a significant delay in breeding replacement animals, or commencing a new lactation. Using records from 9546 goats, the objective of this study was to investigate the genetic relationships between the reproductive traits described above, and the production traits 520-day milk yield (MY520), lifetime milk yield (MYLife) and lifetime number of days in milk (DIMLife). The \u2018out of season\u2019 phenotype was defined as week of kidding relative to the 4 weeks of the year where the highest average number of births occur. Incidences of PPG that occurred during the first lactation were used as cases, while goats with none were assigned as controls. Relevant fixed and random effects were fitted in the models. In line with other reproduction traits, heritability estimates were low ranging from 0.08 to 0.11. A negative genetic correlation was found between AFK and MY520 (\u22120.22\u00b10.10), whereas a positive genetic correlation was found between PPG and DIMLife (0.58\u00b10.11). Pseudopregnancy and OOS were positively genetically correlated (0.36\u00b10.15). All other genetic correlations were very low. The results of this study indicate that selection for the reproductive traits analysed is feasible, without adversely affecting MYLife.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "Genetic parameters were estimated for antibody response to paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis) using milk ELISA test results, collected and analyzed by National Milk Records, from Holstein Friesian cows on UK dairy farms in their first 3 lactations. Milk ELISA test results were obtained from 2007 to 2012 and combined with milk recording data and pedigree information. The reduced data set edited for the purposes of genetic parameter estimation consisted of 148,054 milk ELISA records from 64,645 lactations in 40,142 cows of 908 sires, recorded in 641 herds. Milk ELISA test results were loge-transformed and univariate analysis of 3 alternative animal models and equivalent sire models were considered. The most appropriate model included additive genetic and permanent environmental random effects, whereas maternal effects were significant according to likelihood ratio test and Akaike's information criterion but not for Bayesian information criterion. Heritability and repeatability estimates were 0.06 and 0.37, respectively, for the chosen animal model and its equivalent sire model. A subset of the data including herds with greater than 10% positive tests gave a slightly higher heritability of 0.08. Favorable but generally low significant genetic correlations were obtained between antibody response with 305-d milk yield (\u22120.16), 305-d protein yield (\u22120.16), loge-transformed lactation-average somatic cell count (0.15), and the number of mastitis episodes (0.22). Thus, selection on the antibody response to paratuberculosis, should not be detrimental to production or udder health traits. Testing cattle for paratuberculosis is important for its use in control programs and although the heritability of antibody response was low, breeding against the disease might be a good prospect as a preventative measure to assist together with other approaches in an overall control strategy."

        "abstract": "Identification of genetic markers that affect economi-cally important traits is of high value from a biologi-cal point of view, enabling the targeting of candidate genes and providing practical benefits for the industry such as wide-scale genomic selection. This study is one of the first to investigate the genetic background of economically important traits in dairy goats using the caprine 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. The aim of the project was to perform a genome-wide association study for milk yield and conformation of udder, teat, and feet and legs. A total of 137,235 milk yield records on 4,563 goats each scored for 10 conformation traits were available. Out of these, 2,381 goats were genotyped with the Illumina Caprine 50K BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). A range of pseudo-phenotypes were used including deregressed breeding values and pseudo-estimated breeding values. Genome-wide association studies were performed us-ing the multi-locus mixed model (MLMM) algorithm implemented in SNP & Variation Suite v7.7.8 (Golden Helix Inc., Bozeman, MT). A genome-wise significant [\u2212log 10 (P-value) > 5.95] SNP for milk yield was identi-fied on chromosome 19, with additional chromosome-wise significant (\u2212log 10 (P-value) > 4.46] SNP on chro-mosomes 4, 8, 14, and 29. Three genome-wise signifi-cant SNP for conformation of udder attachment, udder depth, and front legs were identified on chromosome 19, and chromosome-wise SNP were found on chromosomes 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, and 27. The proportion of variance explained by the signifi-cant SNP was between 0.4 and 7.0% for milk yield and between 0.1 and 13.8% for conformation traits. This study is the first attempt to identify SNP associated with milk yield and conformation in dairy goats. Two genome-wise significant SNP for milk yield and 3 SNP for conformation of udder attachment, udder depth, and front legs were found. Our results suggest that con-formation traits have a polygenic background because, for most of them, we did not identify any quantitative trait loci with major effect."

        "abstract": "<p>Improved management and use of estimated breeding values in breeding programmes, have resulted in rapid genetic progress for small ruminants (SR) in Europe and other developed countries. The development of single nucleotide polymorphisms chips opened opportunities for genomic selection (GS) in SR in these countries. Initially focused on production traits (growth and milk), GS has been extended to functional traits (reproductive performance, disease resistance and meat quality). The GS systems have been characterized by smaller reference populations compared with those of dairy cattle and consisting mostly of cross- or multi-breed populations. Molecular information has resulted in gains in accuracy of between 0.05 and 0.27 and proved useful in parentage verification and the identification of QTLs for economically important traits. Except for a few established breeds with some degree of infrastructure, the basic building blocks to support conventional breeding programmes in small holder systems are lacking in most developing countries. In these systems, molecular data could offer quick wins in undertaking parentage verification and genetic evaluations using G matrix, and determination of breed composition. The development of next-generation molecular tools has prompted investigations on genome-wide signatures of selection for mainly adaptive and reproduction traits in SR in developing countries. Here, the relevance of the developments and application of GS and other molecular tools in developed countries to developing countries context is examined. Worth noting is that in the latter, the application of GS in SR will not be a \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 scenario. For breeds with some degree of conventional genetic improvement, classical GS may be feasible. In small holder systems, where production is key, community-based breeding programmes can provide the framework to implement GS. However, in fragile growth systems, for example those found in marginal environments, innovative GS to maximize adaptive diversity will be required. A cost-benefit analysis should accompany any strategy of implementing GS in these systems.<\/p>"

Subsequently, the study aimed to decrease turnoff age, maximization of reproduction rates and minimization of the mature weight of does in the low-input livestock production system in Kenya. Three crossbreeding systems and a synthetic breed development were evaluated, namely; (a) straight breeding system that utilized pure Small East African goat (SEAG) where parental lines were maintained to generate the desired terminal crosses, (b) three-breed crossbreeding system that utilized SEAG as pure breed, Galla goat (GG) as the first cross sire breed, and Improved Boer goat (IBG) as the terminal sire, (c) two-breed rotational crossbreeding system where the SEAG and IBG were purebreds, and (d) synthetic breed development system utilizing SEAG \u00d7 IBG. The HotCross crossbreeding simulation software was used to assess the predicted performance of the different goat breed crosses under conditions of agro ecological zones (AEZ) V and VI. A model was developed to compare these crossbreeding systems, and showed the optimum numbers required in each stage of a cross to maximize production. In the AEZ V, it was found that the three-breed terminal system gave 18.2 kg (76%) improvement over straightbreds per doe mated per year. The multi-breed composite realized 20.4 kg (86%) improvement over pure SEAG. In the AEZ VI, it was found that the three-breed terminal system gave 10 kg (64%) improvement over straightbreds per doe mated per year. The multi-breed composite realized 14.6 kg (94%) improvement straightbreds per doe mated per year. The two-breed rotation was worse than the multi-breed composite in both environments. This implies that in low-input livestock production system, a multi-breed composite may be the crossbreeding system of choice, so long as supportive infrastructure is put in place."

        "abstract": "The study was conducted to characterize the morphological features of Mursi cattle breed and to identify the species of trypanosome infecting the cattle and its prevalence in these traditionally managed cattle in the Bodi and Mursi pastoral communities. Cattle body description and measurements were made on 201 matured animals. Blood samples were collected from 409 animals into heparin-treated capillary tubes and were centrifuged to 12,000 rpm for 5 min to identify trypanosome species from the wet smeared buffy coat and to estimate the degree of anemia (PCV). Tsetse flies were collected using phenol-treated biconical trap and the caught flies identified to species level. The breed possesses variable coat color pattern, coat color type, and have small to medium hump size on the thoracic vertebrae. Body measurement of Mursi cattle in the two locations did not show significant differences except chest girth, rump width, and horn length. Trypanosome prevalence in the Mursi cattle breed was 6.1%. The highest trypanosome infection was caused by Trypanosoma congolense (56%) followed by Trypanosoma vivax (40%) and Trypanosoma brucei (4%). Trypanosome prevalence significantly varies between dry (2.0%) and late rainy (10.1%) seasons (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and between lean (11.9%) and medium (2.4%) body condition score (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The PCV value was 22.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5%, which is significantly varied with season (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and parasitism (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Parasitaemic cattle show the lowest PCV value (20.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091%) than aparasitaemic (23.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3%) cattle and cattle with lean BCS showed the lowest (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) PCV value (20.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%). Tsetse fly species identified in the study area were Glossina pallidipes, Glossina morsitans submorsitans, and Glossina fuscipes. The number of flies captured in late rainy season was higher than in dry season (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Despite the existence of trypanosome and high tsetse fly infestation in the areas, large proportion of the Mursi cattle shows medium BCS, low trypanosome prevalence, and higher PCV value."

        "abstract": "Breeding programmes described as community\u2010based (CBBP) typically relate to low\u2010input systems with farmers having a common interest to improve and share their genetic resources. CBBPs are more frequent with keepers of small ruminants, in particular smallholders of local breeds, than with cattle, pigs or chickens with which farmers may have easier access to alternative programmes. Constraints that limit the adoption of conventional breeding technologies in low\u2010input systems cover a range of organizational and technical aspects. The analysis of 8 CBBPs located in countries of Latin\u2010America, Africa and Asia highlights the importance of bottom\u2010up approaches and involvement of local institutions in the planning and implementation stages. The analysis also reveals a high dependence of these programmes on organizational, technical and financial support. Completely self\u2010sustained CBBPs seem to be difficult to realize. There is a need to implement and document formal socio\u2010economic evaluations of CBBPs to provide governments and other development agencies with the information necessary for creating sustainable CBBPs at larger scales."

        "abstract": "At least 150 indigenous African cattle breeds have been named, but the majority of African cattle populations remain largely uncharacterized. As cattle breeds and populations in Africa adapted to various local environmental conditions, they acquired unique features. We know now that the history of African cattle was particularly complex and while several of its episodes remain debated, there is no doubt that African cattle population evolved dramatically over time. Today, we find a mosaic of genetically diverse population from the purest Bos taurus to the nearly pure Bos indicus. African cattle are now found all across the continent, with the exception of the Sahara and the river Congo basin. They are found on the rift valley highlands as well as below sea level in the Afar depression. These unique livestock genetic resources are in danger to disappear rapidly following uncontrolled crossbreeding and breed replacements with exotic breeds. Breeding improvement programs of African indigenous livestock remain too few while paradoxically the demand of livestock products is continually increasing. Many African indigenous breeds are endangered now, and their unique adaptive traits may be lost forever. This paper reviews the unique known characteristics of indigenous African cattle populations while describing the opportunities, the necessity and urgency to understand and utilize these resources to respond to the needs of the people of the continent and to the benefit of African farmers."

        "abstract": "Survival analysis applying proportional hazards models was used to investigate genetic and non-genetic factors affecting ewe longevity and lamb survival of sheep in Ethiopia. Data were obtained from an on-station closed nucleus breeding program of Menz sheep and an on-farm Awassi\u00d7Menz sheep crossbreeding project. A total of 695 ewes and 1890 lambs born from the nucleus population of Menz sheep were used for the analysis of ewe productive life and lamb survival to yearling age respectively. In addition, 5530 lamb records of purebred local and crossbreds with proportions of ~25\u201350% Awassi, collected from three locations were used for the analysis of lamb survival from birth to weaning age. The effects of year, ewe parity and litter weight at weaning were significant (p<0.05) for ewe productive life. On-station lamb survival to yearling was affected by year and breeding value of yearling weight of the lamb, indicating that faster growing animals had substantially higher survival rates. Animal model heritability estimates for lamb mortality ranged from 0.02 to 0.10. While there was a strong genetic trend for growth rate, as evidenced by estimated breeding values for different birth years, estimated breeding values for lamb survival were variable across years with decreasing trend. These results indicate no antagonism between growth rate and survival under conditions prevailing in the nucleus system. Routine genetic evaluation for survival is suggested. Under farmer conditions, the effects of year, season, sex and location effects were significant (p<0.05) on lamb survival to weaning age whereas breed composition (local versus crossbred) of dam as well as of the lamb were not significant. This seems to indicate that crossbreeding of local animals with Awassi sheep does not have an adverse effect on the survival of lambs under farmer conditions typical for the Ethiopian highland regions included in this study."

        "abstract": "Performance of three generation (G 0 ,G 1 and G 2)of indigenous chicken was evaluated to assess the effect of breeding strategies on the productivity. Data on age at sexual maturity (ASM), body weight at sexual maturity (BWM), body weight at one year of age (BWY), eggs per clutch (EGC), clutches per year (CLY), hatchability on set eggs basis (HAT) and survivability of baby chicks up to sexual maturity (SUR) were collected from a total of 1392 birds reared in four rural villages under traditional scavenging system during December 2010 to June 2013. The birds belong to three generations (G 0 , G 1 and G 2) and are from three breeding strategies (BS 1 use of only pure and superior indigenous mature cocks, BS 2 use of pure and superior indigenous mature cocks and mature hens and BS 3 use of existing or random indigenous cocks and hens). In G 2, the lowest ASM of male birds (156.56\u00b13.39 days) was observed and the highest in BS 2, whereas in BS 3 high BWM and BWY of male (1200.00\u00b119.99; 1779.63\u00b127.20 gm) and female (994.48\u00b110.86; 1350.38\u00b114.46 gm) birds were observed in BS 2 . However, in G 2 the highest EGC (14.97\u00b10.20), CLY (4.53\u00b10.05) and HAT (89.79\u00b10.96%) were observed in BS 1 but the highest SUR (51.15\u00b12.36%) was documented in BS 3. Present study revealed that use of superior Indigenous mature cocks alone and exercising cock rotation program can help to increase egg production, hatchability and decrease ASM of female birds of progressive generations in rural low input system. On the other hand, use of both superior Indigenous mature cocks and hens at a time at farmers end and exercising cock rotation program can help to improve body weight in rural low input system."

        "abstract": "A study was conducted to investigate the performance of mini-hatchery of Indigenous chicken set under four villages of Jhenaigati upazilla of Sherpur district in Bangladesh. A total of 1070 eggs from Indigenous chicken were collected in 4 batches and 628 chicks were hatched artificially. Data were recorded on fertility, hatchability, body weight of chicks from week 1 (BWWK1) to week 17 (BWWK17). Least square means were obtained using SAS GLM and mean comparisons were performed with Duncan's Multiple Range Test. Fertility (%), hatchability (%) and mortality (%) of indigenous chicken eggs were 70.81, 77.52, 19.63, respectively. Comparable fertility and hatchability of Indigenous chicken eggs were found in this study. Body weight of male birds at third, fifth, seventh, eighth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth weeks were significantly higher than females as expected. Male birds were found heavier than the female birds in this study and artificially hatched birds grew better up to 11 weeks of age. The coal brooding system was superior to electric and natural brooding. Hand mixed feed gave better growth of birds than commercial feed and scavenging feed resources. Better growth of farm 2 was observed and replication of management system of farm 2 could be advised for other farmers to get a better growth. Batch, farm, brooding system and feeding system were found to be contributed to significant (P<0.05) differences in the body weight of birds at various weeks of their age. These results indicated that standardization of the management systems is required before implementation of mini hatcheries for incubation of Indigenous chicken eggs in rural areas of Bangladesh."

        "abstract": "<p> This study was conducted to characterize the morphological peculiarities and performance characteristics of Mursi cattle in its production environment managed by Bodi and Mursi pastoral communities in Southern Ethiopia. A structured questionnaire survey, group discussion, cattle morphological measurements and morphological descriptions were used to collect data. One hundred and two household heads were selected to administer the questionnaire and 201 adult cattle were selected for morphological description and body measurements. The Mursi cattle population was found to have variable coat colour type (85.9 percent) and coat colour pattern (51.3 percent). Body length, chest girth, withers height, rump width and rump length of Mursi cattle were 122.1 \u00b1 0.9, 144.5 \u00b1 0.9, 113 \u00b1 0.1.1, 36.9 \u00b1 0.3 and 20.4 \u00b1 0.3 cm, respectively. Morphological measurements of most linear traits show no difference in the two locations but all measurements vary ( <italic>P<\/italic> &amp;lt; 0.001) between males and females. Estimated age at first calving was 4.6 years and was significantly ( <italic>P<\/italic> &amp;lt; 0.0001) higher in the Mursi area, while the calving interval (14.5 months) and cow reproductive life (14.2 years) were the same in both locations. Average daily milk yield (2.1 litres) and lactation length (7.8 months) of Mursi cattle in the two locations were similar. Cattle production was constrained by high disease prevalence, seasonal feed availability, and water shortage, with frequent drought. Trypanosomosis, black leg, anthrax and skin diseases are major cattle diseases reported in the two study areas. Because of its peculiar morphological characteristics, including large body frame, higher production performance, and survivability in the harsh environment, the Mursi cattle can be used as an alternative genetic resource for production improvement programs. <\/p>"

        "abstract": "This study documents the indigenous chicken (IC) production systems and subsequently assesses the contribution of the IC breeds\/ecotypes to the livelihoods of farmers in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. A total of 1125 households keeping chicken participated in this study between 2009 and 2011. All four countries had similar production systems for IC; most IC flocks were raised under the free range system of production, which increased their vulnerability to predation, diseases, poor feeding and inadequate husbandry management. The results show that exits due to mortality were higher than those to other causes such as livelihoods (sales and income), food and nutrition. Chicken flock sizes and production performance also varied significantly across the countries. The main reasons for keeping IC was for home consumption and as an extra income generation activity in addition to the main income activities such as crop farming and off-farm. These reasons were influenced mainly by sources of income of the households, chicken flock sizes and management practises. Understanding these farming system characteristics and their benefits to IC production is thus essential in the development of a holistic breeding and conservation program.

        "abstract": "<p>The CGIAR research programme on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security, in collaboration with several partners is testing a portfolio of interventions to address the threat of changing climatic conditions for smallholder farming communities living beside river flood plains, grouped into \u201cClimate Smart Villages\u201d (CSVs). We present characteristics of farms in CSV in relation to small ruminant (SR) production and the scenario for a breeding and improvement programme. Information was collated using participatory systems research methods from 140 households in seven CSVs in Nyando basin, Kenya. Although most households were headed by men, there were a higher proportion of adult women within the communities, and literacy levels were moderate. A total of 58 percent of the population owned &amp;lt;1 ha of land for growing crops and rearing on average 6.96 \u00b1 3.35 Tropical Livestock Units comprising different species of animals. Women headed households owned more sheep which were mainly crosses of unspecified local breeds, than Goats which were mainly the Small East African breed-type. Mating among the SR was random, with no control of inbreeding as flocks mixed in grazing fields and at water points. Farmers desired large and resilient animals for better market prices; however, growth rates were slow. The SR flocks were dynamic with 31 percent of the animals moving in and out of flocks in a year. A community breeding programme optimally using available resources and incorporating gender integrated innovative technologies could be implemented for the CSV, alongside strong capacity development on animal husbandry, health and marketing of products.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "Meat production is the most important trait in the breeding objectives of sheep production in East Africa. The aim of this study was to investigate breed differences in live weight, conformation, carcass traits and economic values for meat production among Red Maasai and Dorper sheep and their crosses. In total, 88 ram lambs, which were reared at the ILRI experimental station, Kapiti plains Estate in Central Kenya, were used for the study. The lambs were slaughtered at Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) at about 1\u00a0year of age. Prior to slaughter, the lambs were weighed, measured and assessed by experienced evaluators, and at the abattoir carcass traits were recorded. Large breed differences were found for most traits. Dorper lambs were heavier at delivery for slaughter and had better carcass grade but lower dressing percentage and fat levels than Red Maasai. Crossbreds were generally better than the parental breeds. Evaluators were willing to pay more for the Dorper lambs for slaughter although carcass weights later were shown not to be higher than for Red Maasai. Evaluators undervalued Red Maasai lambs by 8-13\u00a0% compared to Dorper lambs according to the prices quoted per kilogramme live or carcass weight by KMC. Live weight was better than any other live measure in predicting carcass weight. Due to the overall higher ranking of the crossbred lambs for meat production, Dorper may be useful as a terminal sire breed for crossing with Red Maasai ewes."

        "abstract": "Smallholder pig farming is an important livelihood source in many rural communities of countries in Asia region such as Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The indigenous pig population is diminishing over the years and it requires a better attention for conservation and sustainable utilization. The objectives of this study were to identify the pig farming system characteristics and investigate the effect of these characteristics on keeping pigs for livelihood in Vietnam and Sri Lanka. A total of 725 households were surveyed including 264 keeping pigs and 461 without pigs. Farming system characteristics were analyzed by descriptive statistics. The effect of farming system characteristics on keeping pigs for livelihood was determined by logistic regression models (Models I and II). The results revealed that majority of famers (&gt;80\uf025) kept indigenous pigs as an income source in both countries. Free range pig rearing system with low cost feeding (mainly the kitchen waste) was predominant in Sri Lanka whereas confined pigs and providing commercial concentrates was mainly practiced in Vietnam. The average herd size was significantly (p&lt;0.05) different in Vietnam (8) and in Sri Lanka (4). Age at first farrowing, farrowing intervals and number of piglets per farrow were higher in Vietnam than in Sri Lanka. The results of model-I showed that family size, availability of piped water, keeping other livestock than pigs, watering pigs adlibitum, positively influenced keeping pigs for home consumption, whereas feeding kitchen waste, availability of water connection in working condition and livestock income negatively influenced for the same attribute. The results of model-II revealed that availability of river water and livestock income have positive impacts while availability of piped water and watering pigs adlibitum have negative impacts on keeping pigs as a income source. These findings will be useful in formulating policies to conserve the gene pool of indigenous pigs and facilitate the indigenous pig production. Increasing indigenous pig production will contribute in considerable level to ensure the food security and income generation of rural families.\n\n\tKey words: Indigenous pigs, livelihood, Sri Lanka, Vietnam"

        "abstract": "Description of the physical characteristics of livestock breeds is very important for developing a breeding strategy in a particular production system. Doyogena sheep are among the potential breeds of Ethiopia reared in the mixed perennial crop and livestock production system of Southern Ethiopia. This research was conducted to characterise the morphological features of Doyogena sheep in an attempt to develop a breeding strategy that suits the production system of the area. A total of 512 sheep were characterized for different morphological features. Most (74.6%) of the sheep in the flock were females and 34.4% were old sheep of four and above dentition classes. Light red and red coat colours were abundant (71.5%) and 74% of the colour pattern was plain. Doyogena sheep are long fat-tailed (100%) and short haired (93.4%). The overall least square mean body weight was 31.64\u00b10.43 kg and was affected by sex and age of sheep. The mean heart girth (74.08\u00b10.39 cm), body length (58.84\u00b10.30 cm), and height at rump (69.71\u00b10.29 cm) were also affected by sex and dentition. Positive and significant correlations were obtained between body weight and other linear body measurements. The highest correlation coefficient was between body weight and heart girth. The positive and significant correlation of weight with linear body measurements indicate that linear body measurements can be used as a marker to estimate weight for different purposes. Different models can be used for different purposes. For simplicity, models with one variable can be used for marketing and by farmers. For breeding and selection purposes, since there is a need to be more precise, use of models involving more number of variables is important."

        "abstract": "<p>Development of the livestock industry and its role in poverty alleviation in developing countries depends on how adaptive the production systems are to changing global environmental and economic trends. This paper characterizes dairy production systems in India, Tanzania, Kenya and Nicaragua, and describes the genetic and breeding technologies that hold promise for the advancement of global development goals. The dairy value chain has been prioritized for development under the CGIAR research programme on Livestock and Fish in Tanzania (East Africa), India (South Asia) and Nicaragua (Latin America), while ILRI is involved in research on dairy development in Kenya. In all the countries, a large number of smallholder farmers operating mixed crop\u2013livestock production systems play a significant role in dairy production. In Tanzania, Kenya and Nicaragua, milk is predominantly produced by cattle of genotypes that differ both across countries and among production systems within the same country. In India, buffaloes contribute to a larger proportion of the national milk than cattle. Information on productivity per animal and on optimal genotypes to utilize within the smallholder production systems of all the countries is however limited. Crossbreeding and artificial insemination were identified as the most widely utilized breeding and reproductive technologies. Only in Kenya is there a national organization conducting livestock recording and monitoring productivity, however, the proportion of the dairy cattle population enrolled in the recording system is small (&amp;lt;2.5 percent). In all the countries, enhanced and adequately planned use of breeding and reproductive technologies, complemented with the relevant infrastructure, is needed to sustainably increase dairy productivity. The capacities of actors in the dairy value chain need to be developed in order to properly implement and manage improvements.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "Domestic goat is the first ruminant animal domesticated in the South-west Asia about 10,500 years ago from its Capra aegagrus and Capra falconeri ancestors. The archaeological evidence links its origin to the region from the Taurus Mountains of Turkey to Pakistan. Molecular data extends the origin upto the Balkans and Carpathian Mountain regions of Romania, and China. Domestic goat followed both the Mediterranean and Danubian routes to disperse into Europe, and the Silk Road and the Khyber Pass to disperse across Asia. From the six haplogroups (A, B, C, D, F and G) of domestic goat globally identified, haplogroup A has a global coverage of 89% in Asia, 98% in Europe, and absolute predominance (100%) in South and Central America; however, the African region is still poorly characterized. The predominance of haplogroups A could be as a result of its earliest domestication. Haplogroup B, C, D, F and G are very rare or even absent (e.g. haplogroups D) in Europe. Haplogroup C is present with very low frequencies in Europe (2%), Asia (1%) and in Mongolia. MtDNA lineage B was detected in few African countries and few countries in Europe, Middle East and Asia. Overall, population expansion events of the wild progenitors of domestic goats were occurred much earlier than the events of domestication."

The sequences were derived from parasites in 23 buffalo-derived cell lines, three cattle-derived isolates and one cloned cell line obtained from a buffalo-derived stabilate. The results revealed substantial variation among the antigens through sequence diversity. The greatest nucleotide and amino acid diversity were observed in Tp1, Tp2 and Tp9. Tp5 and Tp7 showed the least amount of allelic diversity, and Tp5, Tp6 and Tp7 had the lowest levels of protein diversity. Tp6 was the most conserved protein; only a single non-synonymous substitution was found in all obtained sequences. The ratio of non-synonymous: synonymous substitutions varied from 0.84 (Tp1) to 0.04 (Tp6). Apart from Tp2 and Tp9, we observed no variation in the other defined CD8+ T cell epitopes (Tp4, 5, 7 and 8), indicating that epitope variation is not a universal feature of <italic>T. parva<\/italic> antigens. In addition to providing markers that can be used to examine the diversity in <italic>T. parva<\/italic> populations, the results highlight the potential for using conserved antigens to develop vaccines that provide broad protection against <italic>T. parva<\/italic> . <\/p>"

        "abstract": "The study was conducted to differentiate the Woyto-Guji and Central Highland goat breeds of Ethiopia and derive the most accurate linear regression equation for live body weight prediction. Morphological measurements were taken on randomly selected 531 adult female goats (263 from Woyto-Guji and 268 from Central Highland). Positive and highly significant (P<0.001) correlations were observed between body weight and most independent body measurement variables in both breeds. The highest relationship between chest girth and body weight were illustrated in both breeds (r=0.85 for Woyto-Guji and r=0.82 for Central Highland). The multiple regressions found five parameters to be significant (P<0.05) for Woyto-Guji (chest girth, body length, pelvic width, chest width and ramp length) and Central Highland (chest girth, body length, ramp length, horn and ear length) with R2 values of 84% and 79%, respectively. Body weight, body length, height at wither, chest width, ramp length, pelvic width, horn length and ear length had a significant (P<0.15) discriminating power on the breeds. Nearest neighbor discriminating function analysis shows that 93.23% of Woyto-Guji and 92.96% of Central Highland breeds were classified into their source population. The morphological variations obtained in this study should be consolidated with more evidence drawn from genetic analysis. Key words: Central Highland, goat, multivariate, morphometric traits, Woyto-Guji."

Immunity to T. parva, believed to be mediated by a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, is induced following natural infection and after vaccination with a live vaccine, known as the Infection and Treatment Method (ITM). The most commonly used version of ITM is a combination of parasites derived from three isolates (Muguga, Kiambu 5 and Serengeti-transformed), known as the \u201cMuguga cocktail\u201d. The use of a vaccine comprising several strains is believed to be required to induce a broad immune response effective against field challenge. In this study we investigated whether immunization with the Muguga cocktail induces a broader CTL response than immunization with a single strain (Muguga)."

        "abstract": "Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes an economically important disease of sheep and goats, primarily in developing countries. It is becoming the object of intensive international control efforts. Current vaccines do not allow vaccinated and infected animals to be distinguished (no DIVA capability). We have previously shown that recombinant, replication-defective, adenovirus expressing the PPRV H glycoprotein (AdH) gives full protection against wild type PPRV challenge. We have now tested lower doses of the vaccine, as well as AdH in combination with a similar construct expressing the PPRV F glycoprotein (AdF). We show here that, in a local breed of goat in a country where PPR disease is common (Kenya), as little as 10(7) pfu of AdH gives significant protection against PPRV challenge, while a vaccine consisting of 10(8) pfu of each of AdH and AdF gives apparently sterile protection. These findings underline the utility of these constructs as DIVA vaccines for use in PPR control."

        "abstract": "The Infection and Treatment Method (ITM) of vaccination against the apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva has been used since the early 1970s and is still the only commercially available vaccine to combat the fatal bovine disease, East Coast fever (ECF). The disease is tick-transmitted and results in annual economic losses of at least $300 million per year. While this vaccine technology has been available for over 40 years, few attempts have been made to standardize the production process and characterize the vaccine. The latest batch was produced in early 2008 at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). The vaccine production involves the use of cattle free from parasites routinely monitored throughout the production process, and a pathogen-free tick colony. This paper describes the protocol used in the recent production, and the process improvements, including improved quality control tools, that had not been employed in previous ITM productions. The paper also describes the processes involved in determining the appropriate field dose, which involved a three-step in vivo study with various dilutions of the vaccine stabilate. The vaccine was shown to be safe and viable after production, and a suitable field dose was identified as 1ml of a 1:100 dilution."

        "abstract": "An infection and treatment protocol is used to vaccinate cattle against Theileria parva infection. Due to incomplete cross-protection between different parasite isolates, a mixture of three isolates, termed the Muguga cocktail, is used for vaccination. While vaccination of cattle in some regions provides high levels of protection, some animals are not protected against challenge with buffalo-derived T. parva. Knowledge of the genetic composition of the Muguga cocktail vaccine is required to understand how vaccination is able to protect against field challenge and to identify the potential limitations of the vaccine. The aim of the current study was to determine the extent of genetic and antigenic diversity within the parasite isolates that constitute the Muguga cocktail. High throughput multi-locus sequencing of antigen-encoding loci was performed in parallel with typing using a panel of micro- and mini-satellite loci. The former focused on genes encoding CD8(+) T cell antigens, believed to be relevant to protective immunity. The results demonstrate that each of the three component stocks of the cocktail contains limited parasite genotypic diversity, with single alleles detected at many gene\/satellite loci and, moreover, that two of the components show a very high level of similarity. Thus, the vaccine incorporates very little of the genetic and antigenic diversity observed in field populations of T. parva. The presence of alleles at low frequency (<10%) within vaccine component populations also points to the possibility of variability in the content of vaccine doses and the potential for loss of allelic diversity during tick passage. The results demonstrate that there is scope to modify the content of the vaccine in order to enhance its diversity and thus its potential for providing broad protection. The ability to accurately quantify genetic diversity in vaccine component stocks will facilitate improved quality control procedures designed to ensure the long-term efficacy of the vaccine."

        "abstract": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region contains many genes that are key regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity including the polymorphic MHCI and MHCII genes. Consequently, the characterisation of the repertoire of MHC genes is critical to understanding the variation that determines the nature of immune responses. Our current knowledge of the bovine MHCI repertoire is limited with only the Holstein-Friesian breed having been studied in any depth. Traditional methods of MHCI genotyping are of low resolution and laborious and this has been a major impediment to a more comprehensive analysis of the MHCI repertoire of other cattle breeds. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been used to enable high throughput and much higher resolution MHCI typing in a number of species. In this study we have developed a MiSeq platform approach and requisite bioinformatics pipeline to facilitate typing of bovine MHCI repertoires. The method was validated initially on a cohort of Holstein-Friesian animals and then demonstrated to enable characterisation of MHCI repertoires in African cattle breeds, for which there was limited or no available data. During the course of these studies we identified >140 novel classical MHCI genes and defined 62 novel MHCI haplotypes, dramatically expanding the known bovine MHCI repertoire."

        "abstract": "Most studies of infectious diseases in East African cattle have concentrated on gastro-intestinal parasites and vector-borne diseases. As a result, relatively little is known about viral diseases, except for those that are clinically symptomatic or which affect international trade such as foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease. Here, we investigate the seroprevalence, distribution and relationship between the viruses involved in respiratory disease, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBR), bovine parainfluenza virus Type 3 (PIV3) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in East African Shorthorn Zebu calves. These viruses contribute to the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) which is responsible for major economic losses in cattle from intensive farming systems as a result of pneumonia. We found that calves experience similar risks of infection for IBR, PIV3, and BVDV with a seroprevalence of 20.9%, 20.1% and 19.8% respectively. We confirm that positive associations exist between IBR, PIV3 and BVDV; being seropositive for any one of these three viruses means that an individual is more likely to be seropositive for the other two viruses than expected by chance."

        "abstract": "African Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is the wildlife reservoir of multiple species within the apicomplexan protozoan genus Theileria, including Theileria parva which causes East coast fever in cattle. A parasite, which has not yet been formally named, known as Theileria sp. (buffalo) has been recognized as a potentially distinct species based on rDNA sequence, since 1993. We demonstrate using reverse line blot (RLB) and sequencing of 18S rDNA genes, that in an area where buffalo and cattle co-graze and there is a heavy tick challenge, T. sp. (buffalo) can frequently be isolated in culture from cattle leukocytes. We also show that T. sp. (buffalo), which is genetically very closely related to T.\u00a0parva, according to 18s rDNA sequence, has a conserved orthologue of the polymorphic immunodominant molecule (PIM) that forms the basis of the diagnostic ELISA used for T.\u00a0parva serological detection. Closely related orthologues of several CD8 T cell target antigen genes are also shared with T.\u00a0parva. By contrast, orthologues of the T.\u00a0parva p104 and the p67 sporozoite surface antigens could not be amplified by PCR from T. sp. (buffalo), using conserved primers designed from the corresponding T.\u00a0parva sequences. Collectively the data re-emphasise doubts regarding the value of rDNA sequence data alone for defining apicomplexan species in the absence of additional data. 'Deep 454 pyrosequencing' of DNA from two Theileria sporozoite stabilates prepared from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks fed on buffalo failed to detect T. sp. (buffalo). This strongly suggests that R.\u00a0appendiculatus may not be a vector for T. sp. (buffalo). Collectively, the data provides further evidence that T. sp. (buffalo). is a distinct species from T.\u00a0parva."

The tick-borne protozoan parasite Theileria parva causes two distinct diseases in cattle, East Coast fever and Corridor disease, following infection with parasites derived from cattle or buffalo, respectively. In this study, cattle were immunized with a live sporozoite vaccine containing three T.\u2009parva isolates (the Muguga cocktail), which has been used extensively and successfully in the field to protect against cattle-derived T.\u2009parva infection. The cattle were exposed in a natural field challenge site containing buffalo but no other cattle. The vaccine had no effect on the survival outcome in vaccinated animals compared to unvaccinated controls: nine out of the 12 cattle in each group succumbed to T.\u2009parva infection. The vaccine also had no effect on the clinical course of the disease. A combination of clinical and post mortem observations and laboratory analyses confirmed that the animals died of Corridor disease. The results clearly indicate that the Muguga cocktail vaccine does not provide protection against buffalo-derived T.\u2009parva at this site and highlight the need to evaluate the impact of the composition of challenge T.\u2009parva populations on vaccine success in areas where buffalo and cattle are present."

We have employed a reverse line blot assay to detect the prevalence of tick-borne parasites in an intensively studied cohort of indigenous calves in western Kenya. The calves were recruited close to birth and monitored for the presence of infectious disease for up to 51 weeks. The final visit samples from 453 calves which survived for the study period were analyzed by RLB. The results indicated high prevalences of Theileria mutans (71.6%), T. velifera (62.8%), Anaplasma sp. Omatjenne (42.7%), A. bovis (39.9%), Theileria sp. (sable) (32.7%), T. parva (12.9%) and T. taurotragi (8.5%), with minor occurrences of eight other haemoparasites. The unexpectedly low prevalence of the pathogenic species Ehrlichia ruminantium was confirmed by a species-specific PCR targeting the pCS20 gene region. Coinfection analyses of the seven most prevalent haemoparasites indicated that they were present as coinfections in over 90% of the cases. The analyses revealed significant associations between several of the Theileria parasites, in particular T. velifera with Theileria sp. sable and T. mutans, and T. parva with T. taurotragi. There was very little coinfection of the two most common Anaplasma species, although they were commonly detected as coinfections with the Theileria parasites. The comparison of reverse line blot and serological results for four haemoparasites (T. parva, T. mutans, A. marginale and B. bigemina) indicated that, except for the mostly benign T. mutans, indigenous cattle seem capable of clearing infections of the three other, pathogenic parasites to below detectable levels. Although the study site was located across four agroecological zones, there was little restriction of the parasites to particular zones."

        "abstract": "Due to the absence of accurate pedigree information, it has not been possible to implement genetic evaluations for crossbred cattle in African small-holder systems. Genomic selection techniques that do not rely on pedigree information could, therefore, be a useful alternative. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using genomic selection techniques in a crossbred cattle population using data from Kenya provided by the Dairy Genetics East Africa Project. Genomic estimated breeding values for milk yield were estimated using 2 prediction methods, GBLUP and BayesC, and accuracies were calculated as the correlation between yield deviations and genomic breeding values included in the estimation process, mimicking the situation for young bulls. The accuracy of evaluation ranged from 0.28 to 0.41, depending on the validation population and prediction method used. No significant differences were found in accuracy between the 2 prediction methods. The results suggest that there is potential for implementing genomic selection for young bulls in crossbred small-holder cattle populations, and targeted genotyping and phenotyping should be pursued to facilitate this."

        "abstract": "<p>Developing countries are experiencing an increase in total demand for livestock commodities, as populations and per capita demands increase. Increased production is therefore required to meet this demand and maintain food security. Production increases will lead to proportionate increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions unless offset by reductions in the emissions intensity (Ei) (i.e. the amount of GHG emitted per kg of commodity produced) of livestock production. It is therefore important to identify measures that can increase production whilst reducing Ei cost-effectively. This paper seeks to do this for smallholder agro-pastoral cattle systems in Senegal; ranging from low input to semi-intensified, they are representative of a large proportion of the national cattle production. Specifically, it identifies a shortlist of mitigation measures with potential for application to the various herd systems and estimates their GHG emissions abatement potential (using the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model) and cost-effectiveness. Limitations and future requirements are identified and discussed. This paper demonstrates that the Ei of meat and milk from livestock systems in a developing region can be reduced through measures that would also benefit food security, many of which are likely to be cost-beneficial. The ability to make such quantification can assist future sustainable development efforts.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "The government of Senegal has initiated a National Program for Livestock Development (PNDE) seeking to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of animal-source foods and increase the economic vitality of the value chain by 2026. Improving the productivity and competitiveness of the livestock sector is a key component of the plan. This brief seeks to facilitate the implementation of the dairy cattle sector components of the PNDE, particularly in relation to improving productivity. In doing so it sets out the evidence-based rationale for keeping different dairy cattle breeds\/ crossbreeds under different management systems, and makes recommendations regarding key investments to improve dairy cattle productivity. Research The researchers performed trade-off analysis on different smallholder dairy cattle production systems in Senegal (intensive systems excluded). The systems were defined by breed or crossbreed of dairy cattle kept, and level of animal management employed. While the research primarily focused on comparing the productivity and profitability of the systems, other elements (such as in relation to food safety) were also considered. The project sites were situated in the semi-arid regions of Thi\u00e8s and Diourbel, with an annual rainfall of 300\u2013500 mm (Figure 1). The data was primarily obtained by monitoring"

        "abstract": "Keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs) play a critical role in cross-linking the keratin intermediate filaments to build a hair shaft. The genetic polymorphisms of the bovine KRTAP7-1 gene were investigated for the first time in this study. The complete coding sequence of the KRTAP7-1 gene in 108 domestic yak, taurine and zebu cattle from China and Indonesia were successfully amplified using polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. Only two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (one nonsynonymous at c.7C\/G and another synonymous at c.21C\/T) and three haplotypes (BOVIN-KRTAP7-1*A, B and C) were identified in the complete coding sequence of the bovine KRTAP7-1 gene among all animals. There was no polymorphism across three Chinese indigenous yak breeds and one Indonesian zebu cattle population, all sharing the BOVINKRTAP71*A haplotype. The four taurine cattle populations also had BOVIN-KRTAP7-1*A as the most common haplotype with a frequency of 0.80. The frequency of novel haplotype BOVIN-KRTAP7-1*B was only 0.07 present in one heterozygous animal in each of the four taurine cattle populations, while BOVINKRTAP7- 1*C was only found in a Simmental and a local Chinese Yellow cattle population with frequencies of 0.17 and 0.36, respectively. The monomorphic yak KRTAP7-1 gene in particular, and highly conserved bovine, sheep and goat KRTAP7-1 genes in general, demonstrated its unique intrinsic structural property (e.g., > 21% high glycine content) and primary functional importance in supporting the mechanical strength and shape of hair."

In this study, sequence variation was investigated in the control region (CR) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 135 individuals belonging to five primary domestic Bactrian camel breeds in China and Mongolia. Due to variation of the repeat unit G(T\/C)(AC)n, length heteroplasmy was detected within each camel by direct sequencing and fragment analysis. A high occurrence of mtDNA heteroplasmy, up to 100 percentages was observed in five camel populations. Our study provides the first evidence of extensive length heteroplasmy in Bactrian camels."

        "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to analyze the genetic diversity of five economically important goat breeds of Pakistan, Beetal, Kaghani, Teddy, Nachi and Pahari. Fifteen microsatellite loci recommended by ISAG\/FAO guidelines were investigated for measures of genetic variability, differentiation and population structure. The genetic variability in terms of allelic diversity and heterozygosity were moderate. The estimated inbreeding coefficient was low in all the investigated goat breeds and not significant. Overall, the populations were less diverse than Eurasian goat breeds, but did not exhibit signs of loss of diversity. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed breed differences accounted for 5.42% of total genetic variation indicating low to moderate genetic differentiation among the investigated goat breeds. The genetic structure analysis revealed Teddy, Pahari, and Nachi as distinct breeds, while Beetal and Kaghani form a single genetic group distinct from the other three goats. The mitochondrial DNA control region sequences showed a total of 60 distinct haplotypes belonging to two major maternal lineages A and B1 with a frequency of 76.9% and 23.1% respectively. Comparison of mtDNA sequences from Pakistani, Indian and Iranian goats indicated distinct evolutionary history for Teddy, Beetal, Nachi and Pahari goats different from that of Indian and Iranian goats."

        "abstract": "The present study aimed at the genetic characterization of five major goat populations of Sri Lanka including four indigenous populations (Jaffna Local \u2013 JFL, Kottukachchiya \u2013 KOT, Southern \u2013 SLS and North Central \u2013 SNC) and one stabilized crossbred (German Boer x indigenous goats, also known as \u201cSri Lankan Boer\u201d \u2013 SLB). Genetic diversity was evaluated using 15 microsatellite markers and the mitochondrial DNA D-loop variation. Allelic diversity and observed and expected heterozygosities were moderate, but less than Eurasian and Indian goat breeds. The overall mean estimated inbreeding coefficient (FIS) was 0.069 and significant heterozygote deficiency was detected in JFL (P<0.001), KOT (P<0.01) and SLS (P<0.05), indicating population-specific drift or selection of the loci assessed. Genetic differentiation among populations was low and the phylogenetic clustering pattern was in line with the geographical location of goat populations. Although pair-wise Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord distance clustered SLS and SLB separately from the rest of the populations, Bayesian clustering clearly showed lack of discrete genetic structure in Sri Lankan goat populations despite significant morphological and phenotypic differences among them. Mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequences revealed significantly high haplotype diversity with the existence of maternal haplogroups \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. Analysis of mtDNA sequences indicated maternal origins of Jaffna Local, Kotukachchiya and Sri Lankan South distinct from the other goat populations."

        "abstract": "Goats are an important component of the Vietnamese livestock industry but little is known about their genetic diversity, differentiation and population structure. We evaluated genetic diversity of seven indigenous goat populations located in different provinces (CoVBV (Co goats from Ba Vi), (CoVSL) Co goats from Son La, CoVTH (Co goats from Thanh Hoa), CoVNT (Co goats from Ninh Thuan), CoVHg (Co goats from Ha Giang), BTVBV (Bach Thoa goat from Ba Vi) and BTVNT (Bach Thoa goats from Ninh Thuan)) and used microsatellite markers to assess the gene flow and population structure among them. The basic diversity measures viz. allelic diversity and heterozygosity were low in Vietnam goats as compared to West Asian and European goats. The overall mean FIS was significantly positive in Co goats (0.203) whereas it was only 0.003 in Bach Thao goats. Considerable genetic differentiation existed among goat populations from different provinces with the mean global FST, FIT and FIS estimated to be 0.083, 0.178 and 0.104 respectively. The phylogenetic tree constructed on pair-wise allele sharing distances revealed clustering of the two Bach Thao goat populations together. Among the Co goat populations, Son La (CoVSL) and Ha Giang (CovHG) clustered together distinctly while Thanh Hoa (CoVTH), Ba Vi (CoVBV) and Ninh Thuan (CoVNT) populations clustered intermediately. The results of multi-dimensional scaling plot of pairwise FST showed a similar picture except that Co-Ninh Thuan (CoVNT) was differentiated from other Co goat populations. When genotype assignment was performed at breed level, the percent correct assignment of Bach Thao goats (93.7%\u201396.2%) was consistently higher than Co goats (86.8%\u201388.1%) across the three evaluated methods. When genotype assignment at sub-population level was done, both Co (CoVNT) and Bach Thao (BTHNT) goat populations in Ninh Thuan province were assigned correctly while the percent correct assignment differed among goat populations from other provinces. AMOVA and Bayesian clustering analysis revealed the existence of significant sub-population structure and varying levels of admixture within Co goats among different provinces. The present study is the first report on genetic diversity and structure of indigenous goat populations raised in different provinces of Vietnam."

Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Myanmar and India were supported to conduct breed surveys, evaluate production environments and assess phenotypic and genetic characteristics of indigenous breeds\/populations. This paper reports genetic diversity of 57 goat breeds of Asia located in nine countries and genetic relationship\/population structure of 43 breeds located in seven countries. The level of genetic variability among goat breeds\/populations across Asia was consistent with the history of domestication, variability being higher near the center of domestication and a decreasing gradient while moving away from this center. Positive directional selection was observed at one or a few microsatellite loci in goat populations of at least four Asian countries including Sri Lanka, India, Iran and Myanmar. Genetic differentiation among goat breeds\/populations within different countries varied from 1.9% (Myanmar goats) to 12.6% (Indonesian goats) with a global FST of 12.7%. Genetic differentiation among local goats within countries was limited, an indication of high gene flow across breeds\/populations. The microsatellite based phylogeny showed two major clades: the Chinese goats clustered distinctly while the goat breeds from other countries clustered separately in a single clade. Weak genetic structure was observed in Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Myanmar goats, moderately strong genetic structure was observed in Pakistani goats while strong genetic structure was observed in Indonesian, Iranian, Vietnamese and Chinese goats. Model based cluster analysis of metadata broadly grouped Asian goats into two major geographical clusters (Chinese and West Asian) which can be partitioned further into four groups: Chinese, West Asian, South East Asian and South Asian. The results from this study clearly established the genetic distinctness of Chinese goats from other major Asian goat breeds."

        "abstract": "The East African Shorthorn Zebu (EASZ) cattle are ancient hybrid between Asian zebu \u00d7 African taurine cattle preferred by local farmers due to their adaptability to the African environment. The genetic controls of these adaptabilities are not clearly understood yet. Here, we genotyped 92 EASZ samples from Kenya (KEASZ) with more than 770,000 SNPs and sequenced the genome of a pool of 10 KEASZ. We observe an even admixed autosomal zebu \u00d7 taurine genomic structure in the population. A total of 101 and 165 candidate regions of positive selection, based on genome-wide SNP analyses (meta-SS, Rsb, iHS, and \u0394AF) and pooled heterozygosity (Hp) full genome sequence analysis, are identified, in which 35 regions are shared between them. A total of 142 functional variants, one novel, have been detected within these regions, in which 30 and 26 were classified as of zebu and African taurine origins, respectively. High density genome-wide SNP analysis of zebu \u00d7 taurine admixed cattle populations from Uganda and Nigeria show that 25 of these regions are shared between KEASZ and Uganda cattle, and seven regions are shared across the KEASZ, Uganda, and Nigeria cattle. The identification of common candidate regions allows us to fine map 18 regions. These regions intersect with genes and QTL associated with reproduction and environmental stress (e.g., immunity and heat stress) suggesting that the genome of the zebu \u00d7 taurine admixed cattle has been uniquely selected to maximize hybrid fitness both in terms of reproduction and survivability."

        "abstract": "The research objective was to develop a thermostable vaccine against peste des petits ruminants (PPR), a morbilliviral disease of small ruminants targeted for eradication that is a major constraint on the livelihoods of the rural poor throughout much of Africa and Asia. Although existing PPR vaccines provide life-long immunity, they require continuous refrigeration. This limits their utility in developing countries. Methods for the lyophilization of a related morbillivirus, rinderpest (RP), resulted in vaccine that could be used in the field for up to 30days without refrigeration which was a major contribution to the global eradication of RP completed in 2011. The present research applied the rinderpest lyophilization method to the attenuated Nigeria 75\/1 PPR vaccine strain, and measured thermostability in accelerated stability tests (AST) at 37\u00b0C. The shelf-life of the vaccine was determined as the time a vial retained the minimum dose required as a 25-dose presentation at the specified temperature. A lactalbumin hydrolysate and sucrose (LS) stabilizer was compared to stabilizers based on trehalose. PPR vaccine produced using the Xerovac drying method was compared to vaccine produced using the rinderpest lyophilization method in AST. LS vaccine was evaluated in AST at 37, 45 and 56\u00b0C and an Arrhenius plot was constructed for estimation of stability at temperatures not tested. Vaccines produced using LS and the rinderpest method of lyophilization were the most stable. The shelf-life of the Xerovac preparation was 22.2days at 37\u00b0C. The three LS vaccine batches had shelf-lives at 37\u00b0C of 177.6, 105.0 and 148.9days, respectively, at 37\u00b0C. At 56\u00b0C, the shelf-life was 13.7days. The projected half-life at 25\u00b0C was 1.3years. This is sufficient thermostability for use without a cold chain for up to 30days which will greatly facilitate the delivery of vaccination in the global eradication of PPR."

        "abstract": "Butana and Kenana are two types of zebu cattle found in Sudan. They are unique amongst African indigenous zebu cattle because of their high milk production. Aiming to understand their genome structure, we genotyped 25 individuals from each breed using the Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip. Genetic structure analysis shows that both breeds have an admixed genome composed of an even proportion of indicine (0.75 \u00b1 0.03 in Butana, 0.76 \u00b1 0.006 in Kenana) and taurine (0.23 \u00b1 0.009 in Butana, 0.24 \u00b1 0.006 in Kenana) ancestries. We also observe a proportion of 0.02 to 0.12 of European taurine ancestry in ten individuals of Butana that were sampled from cattle herds in Tamboul area suggesting local crossbreeding with exotic breeds. Signatures of selection analyses (iHS and Rsb) reveal 87 and 61 candidate positive selection regions in Butana and Kenana, respectively. These regions span genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with biological pathways that are important for adaptation to marginal environments (e.g., immunity, reproduction and heat tolerance). Trypanotolerance QTL are intersecting candidate regions in Kenana cattle indicating selection pressure acting on them, which might be associated with an unexplored level of trypanotolerance in this cattle breed. Several dairy traits QTL are overlapping the identified candidate regions in these two zebu cattle breeds. Our findings underline the potential to improve dairy production in the semi-arid pastoral areas of Africa through breeding improvement strategy of indigenous local breeds."

        "abstract": "Hair sheep of Caribbean origin have become an important part of the U.S. sheep industry. Their lack of wool eliminates a number of health concerns and drastically reduces the cost of production. More importantly, Caribbean hair sheep demonstrate robust production performance even in the presence of drug-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes, a rising concern to the industry. Despite the growing importance of hair sheep in the Americas their genetic origins have remained speculative. Prior to this report no genetic studies were able to identify a unique geographical origin of hair sheep in the New World. Our study clarifies the African and European ancestry of Caribbean hair sheep. Whole-genome structural analysis was conducted on four established breeds of hair sheep from the Caribbean region. Using breeds representing Africa and Europe we establish an objective measure indicating Caribbean hair sheep are derived from Iberian and West African origins. Caribbean hair sheep result from West African introgression into established ecotypes of Iberian descent. Genotypes from 47,750 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 290 animals were used to characterize the population structure of the St. Croix, Barbados Blackbelly, Morada Nova, and Santa Ines. Principal components, admixture, and phylogenetic analyses results correlate with historical patterns of colonization and trade. These patterns support co-migration of these sheep with humans."

        "abstract": "Cockfighting chickens are popular in Pakistan for their fighting behavior, good quality meat and as an attractive household bird. In this study, a total of 195 cockfighting chickens were evaluated for their morphological data during August 2013 to September 2014. Morphological data of cockfighting chickens were obtained from six regions of Pakistan including Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit Baltistan, Federally Administrated Tribal Areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The data were analysed statistically using ANOVA test. Aseel chicken varieties in this study were characterized by red, black, white, and wheaten plumage; yellow and brown shank; yellow beak with black patches; small earlobes; pea comb; yellow eye color and minimal wattles. Great diversity with respect to plumage was witnessed among these varieties. Mianwali Aseel showed significantly lower (p\u22640.05) estimates of mean body weight and body circumference than all other studied varieties. Contrastingly, Kulung and Sindhi varieties showed significantly higher estimates (p\u22640.05) of mean body weight compared to Mianwali, Mushka, Lakha, Java and Peshawari. Mean breast widths, keel lengths, pelvis lengths and body circumferences did not showed any significant difference (p\u22650.05) among the studied varieties. Interestingly, Mianwali Aseel showed significantly higher estimates of mean drum length than Mushka, Sindhi, Kulung and Peshawari Aseels. Thus, we observed great phenotypic diversity among Pakistani cockfighting chickens."

        "abstract": "Pigs were domesticated independently in Eastern and Western Eurasia early during the agricultural revolution, and have since been transported and traded across the globe. Here, we present a worldwide survey on 60K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 2093 pigs, including 1839 domestic pigs representing 122 local and commercial breeds, 215 wild boars, and 39 out-group suids, from Asia, Europe, America, Oceania and Africa. The aim of this study was to infer global patterns in pig domestication and diversity related to demography, migration, and selection. A deep phylogeographic division reflects the dichotomy between early domestication centers. In the core Eastern and Western domestication regions, Chinese pigs show differentiation between breeds due to geographic isolation, whereas this is less pronounced in European pigs. The inferred European origin of pigs in the Americas, Africa, and Australia reflects European expansion during the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. Human-mediated introgression, which is due, in particular, to importing Chinese pigs into the UK during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, played an important role in the formation of modern pig breeds. Inbreeding levels vary markedly between populations, from almost no runs of homozygosity (ROH) in a number of Asian wild boar populations, to up to 20% of the genome covered by ROH in a number of Southern European breeds. Commercial populations show moderate ROH statistics. For domesticated pigs and wild boars in Asia and Europe, we identified highly differentiated loci that include candidate genes related to muscle and body development, central nervous system, reproduction, and energy balance, which are putatively under artificial selection. Key events related to domestication, dispersal, and mixing of pigs from different regions are reflected in the 60K SNP data, including the globalization that has recently become full circle since Chinese pig breeders in the past decades started selecting Western breeds to improve local Chinese pigs. Furthermore, signatures of ongoing and past selection, acting at different times and on different genetic backgrounds, enhance our insight in the mechanism of domestication and selection. The global diversity statistics presented here highlight concerns for maintaining agrodiversity, but also provide a necessary framework for directing genetic conservation."

        "abstract": "Africa is home to numerous cattle breeds whose diversity has been shaped by subtle combinations of human and natural selection. African Sanga cattle are an intermediate type of cattle resulting from interbreeding between Bos taurus and Bos indicus subspecies. Recently, research has asserted the potential of Sanga breeds for commercial beef production with better meat quality as compared to Bos indicus breeds. Here, we identified meat quality related gene regions that are positively selected in Ankole (Sanga) cattle breeds as compared to indicus (Boran, Ogaden, and Kenana) breeds using cross-population (XP-EHH and XP-CLR) statistical methods. We identified 238 (XP-EHH) and 213 (XP-CLR) positively selected genes, of which 97 were detected from both statistics. Among the genes obtained, we primarily reported those involved in different biological process and pathways associated with meat quality traits. Genes (CAPZB, COL9A2, PDGFRA, MAP3K5, ZNF410, and PKM2) involved in muscle structure and metabolism affect meat tenderness. Genes (PLA2G2A, PARK2, ZNF410, MAP2K3, PLCD3, PLCD1, and ROCK1) related to intramuscular fat (IMF) are involved in adipose metabolism and adipogenesis. MB and SLC48A1 affect meat color. In addition, we identified genes (TIMP2, PKM2, PRKG1, MAP3K5, and ATP8A1) related to feeding efficiency. Among the enriched Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) terms, actin cytoskeleton organization, actin filament-based process, and protein ubiquitination are associated with meat tenderness whereas cellular component organization, negative regulation of actin filament depolymerization and negative regulation of protein complex disassembly are involved in adipocyte regulation. The MAPK pathway is responsible for cell proliferation and plays an important role in hyperplastic growth, which has a positive effect on meat tenderness. Results revealed several candidate genes positively selected in Ankole cattle in relation to meat quality characteristics. The genes identified are involved in muscle structure and metabolism, and adipose metabolism and adipogenesis. These genes help in the understanding of the biological mechanisms controlling beef quality characteristics in African Ankole cattle. These results provide a basis for further research on the genomic characteristics of Ankole and other Sanga cattle breeds for quality beef."

        "abstract": "An infection and treatment protocol involving infection with a mixture of three parasite isolates and simultaneous treatment with oxytetracycline is currently used to vaccinate cattle against Theileria parva. While vaccination results in high levels of protection in some regions, little or no protection is observed in areas where animals are challenged predominantly by parasites of buffalo origin. A previous study involving sequencing of two antigen-encoding genes from a series of parasite isolates indicated that this is associated with greater antigenic diversity in buffalo-derived T. parva. The current study set out to extend these analyses by applying high-throughput sequencing to ex vivo samples from naturally infected buffalo to determine the extent of diversity in a set of antigen-encoding genes. Samples from two populations of buffalo, one in Kenya and the other in South Africa, were examined to investigate the effect of geographical distance on the nature of sequence diversity. The results revealed a number of significant findings. First, there was a variable degree of nucleotide sequence diversity in all gene segments examined, with the percentage of polymorphic nucleotides ranging from 10% to 69%. Second, large numbers of allelic variants of each gene were found in individual animals, indicating multiple infection events. Third, despite the observed diversity in nucleotide sequences, several of the gene products had highly conserved amino acid sequences, and thus represent potential candidates for vaccine development. Fourth, although compelling evidence for population differentiation between the Kenyan and South African T. parva parasites was identified, analysis of molecular variance for each gene revealed that the majority of the underlying nucleotide sequence polymorphism was common to both areas, indicating that much of this aspect of genetic variation in the parasite population arose prior to geographic separation."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to assess whether cytotoxic T cells (CTL) generated by the live vaccine, known as \"ITM Muguga cocktail\", which is used for the cattle disease East Cost fever (ECF) in Sub-Saharan Africa, showed a broad reactivity against many different strains of the causative parasite Theileria parva. We also assessed whether immune responses were similar in cattle expressing the same MHC class I haplotypes. RESULTS The antigenic specificity of CTL from MHC class I-matched cattle vaccinated with the Muguga cocktail were different. Three cattle of MHC class I haplotype A18, one A18\/A19 and two haploidentical (A18v\/A12) animals, showed differential recognition of autologous cells infected with a panel of T. parva isolates. This could have implications in the field where certain strains could break through the vaccine. Furthermore, neither of the haploidentical cattle recognized the CTL epitope (Tp1214-224), presented by the A18 haplotype, in contrast to the third animal, showing differences in immunodominance in animals of the same haplotype A18. This suggests that the CTL specificities following immunization with the Muguga cocktail can vary even between haploidentical individuals and that some parasite strains may break through immunity generated by the Muguga cocktail."

        "abstract": "The history of African indigenous cattle and their adaptation to environmental and human selection pressure is at the root of their remarkable diversity. Characterization of this diversity is an essential step towards understanding the genomic basis of productivity and adaptation to survival under African farming systems. We analyze patterns of African cattle genetic variation by sequencing 48 genomes from five indigenous populations and comparing them to the genomes of 53 commercial taurine breeds. We find the highest genetic diversity among African zebu and sanga cattle. Our search for genomic regions under selection reveals signatures of selection for environmental adaptive traits. In particular, we identify signatures of selection including genes and\/or pathways controlling anemia and feeding behavior in the trypanotolerant N\u2019Dama, coat color and horn development in Ankole, and heat tolerance and tick resistance across African cattle especially in zebu breeds. Our findings unravel at the genome-wide level, the unique adaptive diversity of African cattle while emphasizing the opportunities for sustainable improvement of livestock productivity on the continent."

        "abstract": "Cattle keeping is an important livelihood in Senegal. As a part of non-transhumant dairy production analysis to understand factors influencing farmer\u2019s net benefit, we analysed the composition of production stock of small and moderate scale farms in two Senegalese study sites. The data included genotypes of 624 Senegalese cows based on BovineSNP50 BeadChip. Published data of 455 genotypes from 26 breeds was used as a reference. This set included several improved taurine and indicine breeds and African cattle populations. The interviews and field visits suggested the presence of several breeds and crossbreeds. Trained Bayesian clustering analysis supported idea of heterogeneity and uneven influence of non-native taurine and indicine cattle was detected. The main types were Indigenous zebu, Indigenous zebu by Guzerat, Indigenous zebu by improved taurine, and High improved taurine. Identity by descent analysis revealed that cows that were more crossbred also shared a larger proportion of their genomes with each other. Thus, the crossbred cattle are related to each other. This may reflect the higher relatedness within the improved breeds. While the average IBD sharing was low in Indigenous zebu group, the variation across genome regions was more pronounced. Pedigree recording and managed crossbreeding schemes may combine benefits from local and exotic cattle, while limit the increase in the relatedness."

        "abstract": "Polymorphism analysis of the Kisspeptin (KISS1) gene and its association with litter size were conducted in two (Gondar and Woyto Guji) Ethiopian indigenous goat populations. Three new pairs of primers were designed for touchdown PCR condition.&nbsp; A total of 173 and 242 Sanger sequences were employed for further analysis of exon1 (1210 bp) and exon2 (325 bp) regions of the KISS1 gene, respectively. In addition, the identified polymorphic sites were associated with litter size of the animals included in the study. General linear model was carried out for the association analysis. The study revealed that five complete substitutions and 15 polymorphic sites were detected in both exon regions with 2:1 transition and transversion ratio. Most of the polymorphic sites were observed in more than 1% of the sequences qualifying the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) definition. The overall average codon bias index was 0.301 with 64.09 and 62.47% GC contents in exon1 and exon2, respectively. The overall average HE was 0.18863&plusmn;0.21 for exon1 and 0.03155&plusmn;0.01. Only four loci, which constitute 10 genotypes, from the polymorphic sites showed significant contribution of litter size of the goat populations studied. Heterozygous genotypes (TC and GC at g.950T&gt;C and g.3416G&gt;C, respectively) had performed highest estimates of litter size in three of the loci which contributed for litter size. However, the homozygous genotype observed at locus g.3811C&gt;T showed highest contribution for fecundity trait. 18 to 31% performance differences of litter size were observed due to the influence of the genotypes. In conclusion, the SNP detected in those target regions of the gene confirm the contribution of the KISS1 gene for fecundity trait suggesting importance of the gene for marker assisted selection in goat breeding programs.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\tKey words: Goat, litter size, KISS1 gene, polymorphism"

        "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between genetic admixture and performances is crucial for the success of crossbreeding programs. Use of small sets of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) is a cost effective option to estimate the levels of admixture in situations where pedigree recording is difficult. In this study we select AIMs from Ovine 50KSNP data (SNP \u2013 single nucleotide polymorphism) and validate their ability in estimating the contributions of parental breeds to get information about optimum admixture levels for smallholders. Results We estimated admixture levels using ADMIXTURE software based on 74 AIMs selected from Ovine 50KSNP data. Awassi x Ethiopian fat-tailed crossbred sheep populations kept in government farms and farmer villages in different districts were included in the study. Mean Awassi levels estimated based on the selected AIMs were close to the Awassi levels obtained from pedigree information. Estimates from the 74 SNPs were compared to subsets of 65, 55, 45, 35, 25 and 15 SNPs selected based on both top and bottom fixation index (FST) rank using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (r = 0.862\u20130.996). A t-test comparison revealed that all SNP subsets had produced similar (P > 0.05) estimates with the 74 SNPs, except for the bottom 15 SNPs (P < 0.05). However estimates based on 45 and above SNP subsets were relatively close to the fitted regression line (r = 0.969\u20130.996). Association of admixture levels with lamb growth showed that Awassi level affected (P < 0.05) eight months weight in both farmer locations, lambs with higher Awassi levels were heavier. Lambing interval of ewes was longer as Awassi level increased, but this drawback was outweighed by the increased productivity of ewes in terms of eight months lamb weight per year. Conclusions The results indicate that the Ovine 50KSNP array is a powerful tool to identify small sets of AIMs for admixture studies. The results of this study reveal about 45AIMs to accurately estimate admixture levels. If admixture estimation service with such low cost SNP chip would be available, farmers would have a clear market advantage without the need to rely on incomplete or possibly inaccurate pedigree records. Based on the results presented here, we were able to suggest optimum levels of breed composition for the two farmer environments investigated."

Australian BTV serotypes have origins in Asia and are distributed across the continent into two distinct episystems, one in the north and another in the east. Culicoides brevitarsis is the major vector of BTV in Australia and is distributed across the entire geographic range of the virus. Here, we describe the isolation and use of DNA microsatellites and gauge their ability to determine population genetic connectivity of C. brevitarsis within Australia and with countries to the north. Eleven DNA microsatellite markers were isolated using a novel genomic enrichment method and identified as useful for genetic analyses of sampled populations in Australia, northern Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor-Leste. Significant (P\u2208 < \u22080.05) population genetic subdivision was observed between all paired regions, though the highest levels of genetic sub-division involved pair-wise tests with PNG (PNG vs. Australia (F < inf > ST < \/inf > \u2208=\u22080.120) and PNG vs. Timor-Leste (F < inf > ST < \/inf > \u2208=\u22080.095)). Analysis of multi-locus allelic distributions using STRUCTURE identified a most probable two-cluster population model, which separated PNG specimens from a cluster containing specimens from Timor-Leste and Australia. The source of incursions of this species in Australia is more likely to be Timor-Leste than PNG. Future incursions of BTV positive C. brevitarsis into Australia may be genetically identified to their source populations using these microsatellite loci. The vector's panmictic genetic structure within Australia cannot explain the differential geographic distribution of BTV serotypes."

Weighted average h<sub>a<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>, h<sub>m<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>, and c<sup>2<\/sup> for growth traits ranged from 0.03 to 0.45, 0.05 to 0.27, and 0.02 to 0.10, respectively. Weighted average h<sub>a<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup> for reproduction and milk production traits ranged from 0.00 to 0.17 and 0.15 to 0.22, respectively. Weighted R for the growth, reproduction, and milk production traits ranged from 0.06 to 0.56, 0.06 to 0.13, and 0.50 to 0.61, respectively. Weighted averages of r<sub>p<\/sub> and rg among growth traits ranged from \u22120.06 to 0.84 and 0.01 to 0.98, respectively.

In most cases average h<sub>a<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup> and r<sub>g<\/sub> had higher observed standard deviations compared to the theoretical standard error. The present finding revealed that weighted average h<sub>a<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>, h<sub>m<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>, c<sup>2<\/sup>, R, and r<sub>g<\/sub> are more reliable for two reasons: estimates of h<sub>a<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup> for some growth traits were more conservative than values from relatively higher number of records and the absence of significant effects of the tested fixed factors on some parameter estimates. However, studies on genetic parameter estimations are required for growth, reproduction, and milk traits in goats.<\/p>"

        "abstract": "Domestic goat is the first ruminant animal domesticated in the South-west Asia about 10,500 years ago from its Capra aegagrus and Capra falconeri ancestors. The archaeological evidence links its origin to the region from the Taurus Mountains of Turkey to Pakistan. Molecular data extends the origin upto the Balkans and Carpathian Mountain regions of Romania, and China. Domestic goat followed both the Mediterranean and Danubian routes to disperse into Europe, and the Silk Road and the Khyber Pass to disperse across Asia. From the six haplogroups (A, B, C, D, F and G) of domestic goat globally identified, haplogroup A has a global coverage of 89% in Asia, 98% in Europe, and absolute predominance (100%) in South and Central America; however, the African region is still poorly characterized. The predominance of haplogroups A could be as a result of its earliest domestication. Haplogroup B, C, D, F and G are very rare or even absent (e.g. haplogroups D) in Europe. Haplogroup C is present with very low frequencies in Europe (2%), Asia (1%) and in Mongolia. MtDNA lineage B was detected in few African countries and few countries in Europe, Middle East and Asia. Overall, population expansion events of the wild progenitors of domestic goats were occurred much earlier than the events of domestication."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Smallholder dairy farming in much of the developing world is based on the use of crossbred cows that combine local adaptation traits of indigenous breeds with high milk yield potential of exotic dairy breeds. Pedigree recording is rare in such systems which means that it is impossible to make informed breeding decisions. High-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays allow accurate estimation of breed composition and parentage assignment but are too expensive for routine application. Our aim was to determine the level of accuracy achieved with low-density SNP assays. METHODS We constructed subsets of 100\u00a0to\u00a01500 SNPs from the 735k-SNP Illumina panel by selecting: (a) on high minor allele frequencies (MAF) in a crossbred population; (b) on large differences in allele frequency between ancestral breeds; (c) at random; or (d) with a differential evolution algorithm. These panels were tested on a dataset of 1933 crossbred dairy cattle from Kenya\/Uganda and on crossbred populations from Ethiopia (N\u00a0=\u00a0545) and Tanzania (N\u00a0=\u00a0462). Dairy breed proportions were estimated by using the ADMIXTURE program, a regression approach, and SNP-best linear unbiased prediction, and tested against estimates obtained by ADMIXTURE based on the 735k-SNP panel. Performance for parentage assignment was based on opposing homozygotes which were used to calculate the separation value (sv) between true and false assignments. RESULTS Panels of SNPs based on the largest differences in allele frequency between European dairy breeds and a combined Nelore\/N'Dama population gave the best predictions of dairy breed proportion (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.962\u00a0to\u00a00.994 for 100\u00a0to\u00a01500 SNPs) with an average absolute bias of 0.026. Panels of SNPs based on the highest MAF in the crossbred population (Kenya\/Uganda) gave the most accurate parentage assignments (sv\u00a0=\u00a0-1 to 15 for 100 to 1500 SNPs). CONCLUSIONS Due to the different required properties of SNPs, panels that did well for breed composition did poorly for parentage assignment and vice versa. A combined panel of 400 SNPs was not able to assign parentages correctly, thus we recommend the use of 200 SNPs either for breed proportion prediction or parentage assignment, independently."

        "abstract": "\u00a9 2016 The Author(s). Background: The advent of genotyping by Next Generation Sequencing has enabled rapid discovery of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and high throughput genotyping of large populations at an affordable cost. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS), a reduced representation library sequencing method, allows highly multiplexed sequencing of genomic subsets. This method has limitations for small organisms with low amounts of genomic DNA, such as the bluetongue virus (BTV) vectors, Culicoides midges. Results: This study employed the GBS method to isolate SNP markers de novo from whole genome amplified Culicoides brevitarsis genomic DNA. The individuals were collected from regions representing two different Australian patterns of BTV strain distribution: the Northern Territory (NT) and the east coast. We isolated 8145 SNPs using GBS. Phylogenetic analysis conducted using the filtered 3263 SNPs revealed the presence of a distinct C. brevitarsis sub-population in the NT and this was confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA. Two loci showed a very strong signal for selection and were unique to the NT population. Bayesian analysis with STRUCTURE indicated a possible two-population cluster. Conclusions: The results suggest that genotyping vectors with high density markers in combination with biological and environmental data is useful. However, more extensive sampling over a wider spatial and temporal range is needed. The presence of sub-structure in populations and loci under natural selection indicates the need for further investigation of the role of vectors in shaping the two Australian systems of BTV transmission. The described workflow is transferable to genotyping of small, non-model organisms, including arthropod vectors of pathogens of economic and medical importance."

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitic infection is the main health constraint for small ruminant production, causing loss of weight and\/or death. Red Maasai sheep have adapted to a tropical environment where extreme parasite exposure is a constant, especially with highly pathogenic Haemonchus contortus. This breed has been reported to be resistant to gastrointestinal parasite infection, hence it is considered an invaluable resource to study associations between host genetics and resistance. The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms strongly associated with host resistance in a double backcross population derived from Red Maasai and Dorper sheep using a SNP-based GWAS analysis. The animals that were genotyped represented the most resistant and susceptible individuals based on the tails of phenotypic distribution (10% each) for average faecal egg counts (AVFEC). AVFEC, packed cell volume (AVPCV), and live weight (AVLWT) were adjusted for fixed effects and co-variables, and an association analysis was run using EMMAX. Revised significance levels were calculated using 100,000 permutation tests. The top five significant SNP markers with - log10 p-values >3.794 were observed on five different chromosomes for AVFEC, and BLUPPf90\/PostGSf90 results confirmed EMMAX significant regions for this trait. One of these regions included a cluster of significant SNP on chromosome (Chr) 6 not in linkage disequilibrium to each other. This genomic location contains annotated genes involved in cytokine signalling, haemostasis and mucus biosynthesis. Only one association detected on Chr 7 was significant for both AVPCV and AVLWT. The results generated here reveal candidate immune variants for genes involved in differential response to infection and provide additional SNP marker information that has potential to aid selection of resistance to gastrointestinal parasites in sheep of a similar genetic background to the double backcross population."

        "abstract": "Since domestication, the genome landscape of cattle has been changing due to natural and artificial selection forces resulting in several general and specialized cattle breeds of the world. Identifying genomic regions affected due to these forces in livestock gives an insight into the history of selection for economically important traits and genetic adaptation to specific environments of the populations under consideration. This study explores the genes\/genomic regions under selection in relation to the phenotypes of Holstein, Hanwoo, and N\u2019Dama cattle breeds using Tajima\u2019s D, XP-CLR, and XP-EHH population statistical methods. The whole genomes of 10 Holstein (South Korea), 11 Hanwoo (South Korea), and 10 N\u2019Dama (West Africa\u2014Guinea) cattle breeds re-sequenced to ~11x coverage and retained 37 million SNPs were used for the study. Selection signature analysis revealed 441, 512, and 461 genes under selection from Holstein, Hanwoo, and N\u2019Dama cattle breeds, respectively. Among all these, seven genes including ARFGAP3, SNORA70, and other RNA genes were common between the breeds. From each of the gene lists, significant functional annotation cluster terms including milk protein and thyroid hormone signaling pathway (Holstein), histone acetyltransferase activity (Hanwoo), and renin secretion (N\u2019Dama) were enriched. Genes that are related to the phenotypes of the respective breeds were also identified. Moreover, significant breed-specific missense variants were identified in CSN3, PAPPA2 (Holstein), C1orf116 (Hanwoo), and COMMD1 (N\u2019Dama) genes. The genes identified from this study provide an insight into the biological mechanisms and pathways that are important in cattle breeds selected for different traits of economic significance."

        "abstract": "It is estimated that 14% of the livestock in Eastern Africa are comprised of 146 million goats. The goats are in varying agroecological zones under farming systems ranging from small-scale mixed crop\u2013livestock systems with a few animals raised on limited land resources, to extensive pastoral systems where large numbers of animals are raised on large tracts of land. The goats are raised primarily for meat, with milk treated as a secondary trait. Use of goat products at rural household levels in the region is not well documented. The goat populations have been developed over time through selection processes resulting in diverse goat breeds, with some adapted to harsh environmental conditions. In recent years, a strong drive to increase the productivity of goats has resulted in changes in breeding and management strategies and practices, including introduction of foreign breeds, mainly from temperate environments for use in crossbreeding programs, and a narrowing of the range and diversity of indigenous breed types. This, in addition to a lack of detailed information on the characteristics of the indigenous breeds, threatens the existing diversity of goat populations. This chapter presents an overview of the present-day indigenous goat breeds and the production systems under which they are raised in Eastern Africa. The chapter also highlights key constraints to improving goat productivity and outlines opportunities and changes to mitigate threats within the farming systems. The growing populations of goats and their potential for improving the livelihood of different communities call for innovative strategies to reduce their environmental footprint in the existing ecosystems."

        "abstract": "Sheep in Ethiopia are adapted to a wide range of environments, including extreme habitats. Elucidating their genetic diversity is critical for improving breeding strategies and mapping quantitative trait loci associated with productivity. To this end, the present study investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of five Ethiopian sheep populations exhibiting distinct phenotypes and sampled from distinct production environments, including arid lowlands and highlands. To investigate the genetic relationships in greater detail and infer population structure of Ethiopian sheep breeds at the continental and global levels, we analyzed genotypic data of selected sheep breeds from the Ovine SNP50K HapMap dataset. All Ethiopian sheep samples were genotyped with Ovine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip (600K). Mean genetic diversity ranged from 0.29 in Arsi-Bale to 0.32 in Menz sheep, while estimates of genetic differentiation among populations ranged from 0.02 to 0.07, indicating low to moderate differentiation. An analysis of molecular variance revealed that 94.62 and 5.38% of the genetic variation was attributable to differences within and among populations, respectively. Our population structure analysis revealed clustering of five Ethiopian sheep populations according to tail phenotype and geographic origin-i.e., short fat-tailed (very cool high-altitude), long fat-tailed (mid to high-altitude), and fat-rumped (arid low-altitude), with clear evidence of admixture between long fat-tailed populations. North African sheep breeds showed higher levels of within-breed diversity, but were less differentiated than breeds from Eastern and Southern Africa. When African breeds were grouped according to geographic origin (North, South, and East), statistically significant differences were detected among groups (regions). A comparison of population structure between Ethiopian and global sheep breeds showed that fat-tailed breeds from Eastern and Southern Africa clustered together, suggesting that these breeds were introduced to the African continent via the Horn and migrated further south."

        "abstract": "The aim of this article was to study opportunities for improvement of the indigenous and threatened Red Maasai sheep (RM) in Kenya, by comparing purebreeding with crossbreeding with Dorper sheep (D) as a terminal breed, in two different environments (Env. A and a harsher Env. B), assuming different levels of genotype\u2010by\u2010environment interaction (G \u00d7 E). Breeding goals differed between environments and breeds. Four scenarios of nucleus breeding schemes were stochastically simulated, with the nucleus in Env. A. Overall, results showed an increase in carcass weight produced per ewe by more than 10% over 15 years. Genetic gain in carcass weight was 0.17 genetic SD\/year (0.2 kg\/year) across scenarios for RM in the less harsh Env. A. For survival and milk yield, the gain was lower (0.04\u20130.05 genetic SD\/year). With stronger G \u00d7 E, the gain in the commercial tier for RM in the harsher Env. B became increasingly lower. Selection of females also within the commercial tier gave slightly higher genetic gain. The scenario with purebreeding of RM and a subnucleus in Env. B gave the highest total income and quantity of meat. However, quantity of meat in Env. A increased slightly from having crossbreeding with D, whereas that in Env. B decreased. A simple and well\u2010designed nucleus breeding programme would increase the genetic potential of RM. Crossbreeding of RM with D is not recommended for harsh environmental conditions due to the large breed differences expected in that environment."

        "abstract": "Indigenous cattle in Africa have adapted to various local environments to acquire superior phenotypes that enhance their survival under harsh conditions. While many studies investigated the adaptation of overall African cattle, genetic characteristics of each breed have been poorly studied. We performed the comparative genome-wide analysis to assess evidence for subspeciation within species at the genetic level in trypanotolerant N\u2019Dama cattle. We analysed genetic variation patterns in N\u2019Dama from the genomes of 101 cattle breeds including 48 samples of five indigenous African cattle breeds and 53 samples of various commercial breeds. Analysis of SNP variances between cattle breeds using wMI, XP-CLR, and XP-EHH detected genes containing N\u2019Dama-specific genetic variants and their potential associations. Functional annotation analysis revealed that these genes are associated with ossification, neurological and immune system. Particularly, the genes involved in bone formation indicate that local adaptation of N\u2019Dama may engage in skeletal growth as well as immune systems. Our results imply that N\u2019Dama might have acquired distinct genotypes associated with growth and regulation of regional diseases including trypanosomiasis. Moreover, this study offers significant insights into identifying genetic signatures for natural and artificial selection of diverse African cattle breeds."

        "abstract": "Measurement of liveweight of stock is one of the most important production tools available to farmers \u2013 playing a role in nutrition, fertility management, health and marketing. Yet most farmers in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to scales on which to weigh cattle. Heart girth measurements (and accompanying algorithms) have been used as a convenient and cost-effective alternative to scales, however despite a plethora of studies in the extant literature, the accuracy and sensitivity of such measures are not well described. Using three datasets from phenotypically and geographically diverse cattle populations, we developed and validated new algorithms with similar R2 to extant studies but lower errors of prediction over a full range of observed weights, than simple linear regression, that was valid for measurements in an unassociated animal population in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results further show that heart girth measurements are not sufficiently sensitive to accurately assess seasonal liveweight fluctuations in cattle and thus should not be relied on in situations where high precision is a critical consideration."

        "abstract": "As African indigenous cattle evolved in a hot tropical climate, they have developed an inherent thermotolerance; survival mechanisms include a light\u2010colored and shiny coat, increased sweating, and cellular and molecular mechanisms to cope with high environmental temperature. Here, we report the positive selection signature of genes in African cattle breeds which contribute for their heat tolerance mechanisms. We compared the genomes of five indigenous African cattle breeds with the genomes of four commercial cattle breeds using cross\u2010population composite likelihood ratio (XP\u2010CLR) and cross\u2010population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP\u2010EHH) statistical methods. We identified 296 (XP\u2010EHH) and 327 (XP\u2010CLR) positively selected genes. Gene ontology analysis resulted in 41 biological process terms and six Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Several genes and pathways were found to be involved in oxidative stress response, osmotic stress response, heat shock response, hair and skin properties, sweat gland development and sweating, feed intake and metabolism, and reproduction functions. The genes and pathways identified directly or indirectly contribute to the superior heat tolerance mechanisms in African cattle populations. The result will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of heat tolerance in African cattle breeds and opens an avenue for further study."

        "abstract": "Livestock are essential for food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as to rural livelihoods. However, despite very large numbers of animals, production is relatively low, though with large differences between breeds, management practices, and environmental conditions. \u2022 The conditions for livestock in sub-Saharan Africa can be harsh, particularly with regard to heat, water scarcity, and unreliable supply of feed. Climate change is likely to exacerbate those challenges. As a result, it is important to breed animals that are not only productive, but also resilient. \u2022 The increased globalization of breeding activities provides opportunities to incorporate genes from a global pool of breeds to improve local livestock populations. Unfortunately, those opportunities have often been misused, by replacing local breeds with unsuitable exotic breeds, or through crossbreeding that has put local breeds in danger of extinction. \u2022 Given the importance of food security on the global development agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals, it is crucial to raise awareness among policy-makers and funding agencies of the importance and multiple roles of livestock, and of ways to improve livestock production. \u2022 A key area to prioritize is action research to design and implement effective livestock recording and breeding programmes. These are needed to characterize potentially valuable genetic resources, to develop systems for monitoring their performance, and to provide means for management and selection of animals for particular environments. \u2022 Systems aimed at increasing livestock productivity must include improved infrastructure and policies to support livestock breeding and sharing of genetic resources across national borders. The objective should be to support sustainable development of all important farm animal breeds and avoid the risk of extinction. In sharing genetic resources, globally, both developed and developing countries should be mindful of the risk of permanently losing genetic variation by replacing breeds. \u2022 Capacity-building is crucial for success. More needs to be invested in training people at all levels, including women who can become livestock entrepreneurs. Higher education programmes focused on animal breeding are also important to train future leaders in the management of genetic resources."

        "abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Wragg et al. Background: EAV-HP is an ancient retrovirus pre-dating Gallus speciation, which continues to circulate in modern chicken populations, and led to the emergence of avian leukosis virus subgroup J causing significant economic losses to the poultry industry. We mapped EAV-HP integration sites in Ethiopian village chickens, a Silkie, Taiwan Country chicken, red junglefowl Gallus gallus and several inbred experimental lines using whole-genome sequence data. Results: An average of 75.22\u00b19.52 integration sites per bird were identified, which collectively group into 279 intervals of which 5% are common to 90% of the genomes analysed and are suggestive of pre-domestication integration events. More than a third of intervals are specific to individual genomes, supporting active circulation of EAV-HP in modern chickens. Interval density is correlated with chromosome length (P < 2.31 -6 ), and 27% of intervals are located within 5kb of a transcript. Functional annotation clustering of genes reveals enrichment for immune-related functions (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results illustrate a non-random distribution of EAV-HP in the genome, emphasising the importance it may have played in the adaptation of the species, and provide a platform from which to extend investigations on the co-evolutionary significance of endogenous retroviral genera with their hosts."
